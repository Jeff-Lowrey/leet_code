# Bandit configuration for LeetCode solutions
# This is a learning/algorithm practice repository, not production security-critical code

# Skip B101 (assert_used) - assertions in test functions are standard practice
# Skip B105 (hardcoded_password_string) - false positives on arithmetic operators
# Skip B311 (random) - pseudo-random is acceptable for algorithm demonstrations
skips: [B101, B105, B311]
