        """
        Approach: Description
        Time Complexity: O(?)
        Space Complexity: O(?)
        """
        # Implementation

    def alternativeMethod(self, params) -> returnType:
        """Alternative approach with trade-offs"""
        # Implementation

# Test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test implementation
```
