# 213. House Robber Ii

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security systems connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[2,3,2]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>3 (maximum money, rob middle house)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Maximum amount robbed in circular arrangement [2,3,2] is 3 (cannot rob houses 0 and 2)</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Houses are circular - can't rob both first and last. Run House Robber I twice: once on houses[0:n-1] and once on houses[1:n]. Take the maximum of both results.

### APPROACH:
1. **Handle single house**: If len(nums) == 1, return nums[0]
2. **Define helper function**: Create rob_linear(houses) to solve linear house robber problem
3. **Case 1 - rob first**: Call rob_linear(nums[:-1]) to rob houses 0 to n-2 (exclude last)
4. **Case 2 - rob last**: Call rob_linear(nums[1:]) to rob houses 1 to n-1 (exclude first)
5. **Compare both cases**: Take maximum of the two results
6. **Return maximum**: Return max(case1, case2) as the maximum money that can be robbed

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Circular: robbing house 0 means can't rob house n-1 and vice versa
- Run house robber I twice: once on [0..n-2], once on [1..n-1]
- Take maximum of two results
- Handles circular constraint by excluding one of the boundary houses
- O(n) time: two passes of O(n) each, O(1) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Step 1: Handle circular array
  Case 1: Rob houses [0:n-1] ‚Üí [2,3] ‚Üí max = 3
  Case 2: Rob houses [1:n] ‚Üí [3,2] ‚Üí max = 3

Step 2: Case 1 detail
  dp[0] = 2
  dp[1] = max(2, 3) = 3

Step 3: Case 2 detail
  dp[0] = 3
  dp[1] = max(3, 2) = 3

Output: 3 (maximum money, rob middle house)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
