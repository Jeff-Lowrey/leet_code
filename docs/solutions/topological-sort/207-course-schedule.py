# Difficulty: Medium

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to `numCourses - 1`.
You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates
that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

Example:
Input: `numCourses = 2`, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should
have finished course 0. So it is possible.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>numCourses = 2`, prerequisites = [[1,0]]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>true</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Course schedule [0,1] means 0 depends on 1; can finish if no cycles</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
This is a cycle detection problem in a directed graph. If there's a cycle in the prerequisite dependencies, it's impossible to complete all courses. Topological sorting can detect cycles while finding a valid course order.

### APPROACH:
1. **Build adjacency list**: Create a graph where each prerequisite points to the courses that depend on it
2. **Calculate in-degrees**: Count incoming edges for each course (number of prerequisites)
3. **Initialize queue**: Add all courses with in-degree 0 (no prerequisites) to the queue
4. **Process courses**: Dequeue a course, increment courses_taken counter
5. **Update dependencies**: For each course that depends on the current course, decrement its in-degree
6. **Add newly available courses**: If a course's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue (all prerequisites met)
7. **Check completion**: Return true if courses_taken equals numCourses (all courses processed), false otherwise (cycle detected)

### WHY THIS WORKS:
In a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), there's always at least one vertex with in-degree 0. By repeatedly removing such vertices, we can process all vertices if and only if there's no cycle.

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
Prerequisites: [[1,0], [2,1], [3,2]]
1. Build graph: 0‚Üí1‚Üí2‚Üí3
2. In-degrees: [0,1,1,1]
3. Start with course 0 (in-degree 0)
4. Take 0 ‚Üí course 1 now has in-degree 0
5. Take 1 ‚Üí course 2 now has in-degree 0
6. Continue until all courses taken

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(V + E)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(V + E)

### EDGE CASES:
- **No prerequisites**: All courses can be taken, return true
- **Self-loop**: Course depends on itself, cycle detected, return false
- **Circular dependency**: Cycle detection returns false
- **Linear chain**: No cycles, courses taken in topological order
- **Disconnected components**: Process each component separately
