# 269. Alien Dictionary

There is a new alien language that uses the English alphabet. However, the order among the letters is unknown to you.

You are given a list of strings words from the alien language's dictionary, where the strings in words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language.

Return a string of the unique letters in the new alien language sorted in lexicographically increasing order by the new language's rules. If there is no solution, return "". If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

A string s is lexicographically smaller than a string t if at the first letter where they differ, the letter in s comes before the letter in t in the alien language. If the first min(s.length, t.length) letters are the same, then s is smaller if and only if s.length < t.length.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>words = ["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rftt"]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"wertf"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Alien dictionary order from ['wrt','wrf','er','ett','rftt'] is 'wertf'</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Build graph from word pairs by comparing adjacent words. Find first different character to establish order. Perform topological sort using DFS or BFS. Detect cycles (impossible ordering).

### APPROACH:
1. **Build graph**: Compare adjacent words to find character ordering
2. **Track indegrees**: Count incoming edges for each character
3. **Initialize queue**: Add characters with indegree 0 to queue
4. **BFS traversal**: While queue not empty, dequeue character
5. **Add to result**: Append character to result
6. **Update neighbors**: For each neighbor, decrement indegree
7. **Add to queue**: If indegree becomes 0, add to queue
8. **Return result**: If all characters processed, return ''.join(result); else return ''

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Build graph from adjacent word pairs: first differing char creates edge
- Topological sort on character DAG gives alien dictionary order
- If cycle detected (via DFS or indegree), no valid ordering exists
- Invalid case: word1 longer than word2 but word1 prefix of word2
- O(n * k) time: n words, k avg length, O(1) space for alphabet-size graph

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: words = ["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rftt"]
Step 1: Build graph from word pairs
  "wrt" vs "wrf": t‚Üíf
  "wrf" vs "er": w‚Üíe
  "er" vs "ett": r‚Üít
  "ett" vs "rftt": e‚Üír

Step 2: Topological sort
  Order: w‚Üíe‚Üír‚Üít‚Üíf

Output: "wertf"
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
