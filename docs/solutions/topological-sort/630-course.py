# Difficulty: Medium

# 630. Course

There are n different online courses numbered from 1 to n. You are given an array courses where courses[i] = [durationi, lastDayi] indicate that the ith course should be taken continuously for durationi days and must be finished before or on lastDayi.

You will start on the 1st day and you cannot take two or more courses simultaneously.

Return the maximum number of courses that you can take.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>courses = [[100,200],[200,1300],[1000,1250],[2000,3200]]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>3 (max courses)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Maximum courses you can take within time limit</dd>
</dl>

### INTUITION:
Greedy: sort courses by deadline. For each course, if time available, add to heap (track duration). If no time, compare with longest course taken. If current shorter, replace longest.

### APPROACH:
1. **Sort by end time**: Sort courses by their deadlines
2. **Initialize heap and time**: Create max heap, set current_time = 0
3. **Iterate courses**: For each course (duration, deadline)
4. **Add to schedule**: Push -duration to heap, add duration to current_time
5. **Check feasibility**: If current_time > deadline, remove longest course
6. **Continue processing**: Handle all courses
7. **Return result**: Return len(heap)

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Sort courses by deadline: greedy choice of course order
- Use max heap to track course durations taken so far
- If current time + duration > deadline, remove longest course (heap top)
- Greedy: always try to fit course, remove longest if conflicts
- O(n log n) for sort + heap operations, O(n) space for heap

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: courses = [[100,200],[200,1300],[1000,1250],[2000,3200]]
Step 1: Sort by end time
  sorted = [[200,1300],[1000,1250],[2000,3200],[100,200]]

Step 2: Greedy selection
  Take course ending at 1300
  Take course ending at 1250 (can't, conflicts)
  Take course ending at 3200
  ...

Output: 3 (max courses)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
