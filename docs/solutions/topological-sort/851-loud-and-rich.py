# 851. Loud And Rich

There is a group of n people labeled from 0 to n - 1 where each person has a different amount of money and a different level of quietness.

You are given an array richer where richer[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that ai has more money than bi and an integer array quiet where quiet[i] is the quietness of the ith person. All the given data in richer are logically correct (i.e., the data will not lead you to a situation where x is richer than y and y is richer than x at the same time).

Return an integer array answer where answer[x] = y if y is the least quiet person (that is, the person y with the smallest value of quiet[y]) among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than the person x.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>richer = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,7],[4,3],[5,3],[6,3]], quiet = [3,2,5,4,6,1,7,0]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>[5,5,2,5,4,5,6,7]</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Person with most wealth has loudness calculated from dependencies</dd>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Build graph of richer relationships. Use DFS with memoization. For each person, recursively find quietest among all richer people. Cache results to avoid recomputation.

### APPROACH:
1. **Build graph**: Create adjacency list where graph[b].append(a) for [a,b] in richer
2. **Initialize answer**: Set answer = [-1] * n
3. **Define DFS**: Implement dfs(node) to find quietest person in richer-or-equal set
4. **Check memo**: If answer[node] != -1, return answer[node]
5. **Initialize with self**: Set answer[node] = node
6. **Explore richer people**: For each person in graph[node], compare quiet values
7. **Update if quieter**: If quiet[dfs(neighbor)] < quiet[answer[node]], update answer[node]
8. **Return result**: Return answer array

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Build graph: richer[i] -> quieter[i] edge
- DFS/BFS from each person, find quietest in reachable set
- Memoization: cache answer[x] to avoid recomputation
- answer[x] = person with minimum quiet value reachable from x
- O(n^2) worst case, O(n + e) with memoization, O(n + e) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: richer = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,7],[4,3],[5,3],[6,3]], quiet = [3,2,5,4,6,1,7,0]
Step 1: Build graph (richer relationships)
  0 ‚Üê 1 ‚Üê 2
  1 ‚Üê 3 ‚Üê 4,5,6
  7 ‚Üê 3

Step 2: DFS to find quietest richer person
  For person 0: check all richer (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
  Find quietest among them

Output: [5,5,2,5,4,5,6,7]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
