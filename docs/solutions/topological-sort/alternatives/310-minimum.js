 *
 * A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.
 *
 * Given a tree of n nodes labelled from 0 to n - 1, and an array of n - 1 edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes ai and bi in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node x as the root, the result tree has height h. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. min(h)) are called minimum height trees (MHTs).
 *
 * Return a list of all MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in any order.
 *
 * The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>n = 6, edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>[3,4]</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>Minimum height tree roots are [0,1] for graph with edges [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]</dd>
 * </dl>

 * <summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>
 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * [This problem requires understanding of topological sort concepts. The key insight is to identify the optimal approach for this specific scenario.]
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Analyze the problem**: Understand the input constraints and expected output
 * 2. **Choose the right technique**: Apply topological sort methodology
 * 3. **Implement efficiently**: Focus on optimal time and space complexity
 * 4. **Handle edge cases**: Consider boundary conditions and special cases
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * - The solution leverages topological sort principles
 * - Time complexity is optimized for the given constraints
 * - Space complexity is minimized where possible
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
 * Input: n = 6, edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]
 * Step 1: Build adjacency list
 *   Degrees: [1,1,1,4,2,1]
 *
 * Step 2: Remove leaves layer by layer
 *   Remove 0,1,2,5: leaves=[3,4]
 *
 *   These are minimum height tree roots
 *
 * Output: [3,4]
 * ```
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(n)
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(1)
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - Empty input handling
 * - Single element cases
 * - Large input considerations
