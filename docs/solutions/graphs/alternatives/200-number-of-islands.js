/**
 * # Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * # 200. Number Of Islands
 *
 * Given an m x n 2D binary grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
 *
 * An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>[["1","1","1","1","0"]</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>1</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>Number of islands in binary grid is 3</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <details>
 * <summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>
 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * This is a classic graph traversal problem where we need to find connected components. Each island is a connected component of '1's (land). We can use DFS or BFS to explore each island completely when we encounter it, then count how many separate islands we find.
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Iterate through grid**: Check each cell in the grid
 * 2. **Find land**: When we find a '1' (land), it's part of an island
 * 3. **Explore island**: Use DFS/BFS to mark all connected land as visited
 * 4. **Count islands**: Each time we start a new DFS/BFS, we found a new island
 * 5. **Mark visited**: Change '1' to '0' or use separate visited array
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * - DFS/BFS explores all connected components (islands) completely
 * - Once we've explored an island, we mark it as visited to avoid double-counting
 * - Each DFS/BFS start represents discovering a new island
 * - 4-directional connectivity defines what constitutes an island
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
 * Grid: [["1","1","1","1","0"],
 *        ["1","1","0","1","0"],
 *        ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 *        ["0","0","0","0","0"]]
 *
 * Process:
 * - Start at (0,0): DFS explores entire connected land mass
 * - Mark all connected '1's as visited: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)
 * - Continue scanning: (1,3) is unvisited land ‚Üí start new DFS
 * - DFS from (1,3) only marks (1,3) as it's isolated
 * - Total islands found: 2
 * ```
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(M √ó N)
 * Where M and N are grid dimensions - we visit each cell at most once
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(M √ó N)
 * For recursion stack in worst case (entire grid is one island) or visited array
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - Empty grid
 * - All water ('0's)
 * - All land ('1's) - single island
 * - Single cell grid
 * - Grid with no islands
