# 997. Find The Town Judge

In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:




You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[(2, [[1,2]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"n={n}, trust={trust} -> Judge: {result}"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>The town judge is person 2 who is trusted by all but trusts no one</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
This is a graph problem where we need to find a node (person) with specific in-degree and out-degree properties. The judge must have in-degree = n-1 (everyone trusts them) and out-degree = 0 (they trust nobody). We can solve this efficiently by tracking trust relationships as a directed graph.

### APPROACH:
1. **Count trust relationships**: Track who trusts whom and who is trusted by whom
2. **Calculate net trust**: For each person, calculate (trusted_by_count - trusts_count)
3. **Find the judge**: The judge will have net trust = n-1 (trusted by n-1 people, trusts 0)
4. **Validate result**: Ensure exactly one person satisfies the judge criteria

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Judge trusts nobody: out-degree = 0
- Everyone else trusts judge: in-degree = n-1
- Net trust = in-degree - out-degree = (n-1) - 0 = n-1
- All other people have net trust < n-1 (they either trust someone or aren't trusted by everyone)

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Person 1: trusts 3, trusted by 0 ‚Üí net = 0 - 1 = -1
Person 2: trusts 3, trusted by 0 ‚Üí net = 0 - 1 = -1
Person 3: trusts 0, trusted by 2 ‚Üí net = 2 - 0 = 2 = n-1 ‚úì
Output: 3 (person 3 is the judge)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(T + N)
Where T is the number of trust relationships and N is the number of people

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(N)
For storing trust counts

### EDGE CASES:
- n = 1: Only one person, they are the judge by default
- Empty trust array with n > 1: No judge possible
- Multiple people with high trust: No unique judge
- Circular trust: No judge possible
