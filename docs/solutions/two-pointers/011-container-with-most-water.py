### INTUITION:
[This problem requires understanding of two pointers concepts. The key insight is to identify the optimal approach for this specific scenario.]

### APPROACH:
1. **Analyze the problem**: Understand the input constraints and expected output
2. **Choose the right technique**: Apply two pointers methodology
3. **Implement efficiently**: Focus on optimal time and space complexity
4. **Handle edge cases**: Consider boundary conditions and special cases

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- The solution leverages two pointers principles
- Time complexity is optimized for the given constraints
- Space complexity is minimized where possible

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]

Step 1: Initialize
  left = 0 (height=1), right = 8 (height=7)
  max_area = 0

Step 2: First iteration
  width = 8 - 0 = 8
  min_height = min(1, 7) = 1
  area = 8 √ó 1 = 8
  max_area = 8
  Move left pointer (smaller height)
  left = 1

Step 3: left=1 (height=8), right=8 (height=7)
  width = 8 - 1 = 7
  min_height = min(8, 7) = 7
  area = 7 √ó 7 = 49
  max_area = 49
  Move right pointer (smaller height)
  right = 7

Step 4: left=1 (height=8), right=7 (height=3)
  width = 7 - 1 = 6
  min_height = min(8, 3) = 3
  area = 6 √ó 3 = 18
  max_area = 49 (no change)
  Move right pointer
  right = 6

Step 5: Continue until left >= right...

Output: 49
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
