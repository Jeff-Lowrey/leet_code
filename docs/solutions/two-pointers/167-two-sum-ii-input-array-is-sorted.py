# 167. Two Sum Ii Input Array Is Sorted

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[1, 2]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"Expected {expected}, got {result}"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Two numbers [2,7] at indices [1,2] sum to target 9</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Array is sorted, so use two pointers from both ends. If sum < target, move left pointer right. If sum > target, move right pointer left. If equal, found the pair.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize pointers**: Set left = 0, right = len(numbers) - 1
2. **Loop while left < right**: Continue until pointers meet
3. **Calculate sum**: current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
4. **Check if found**: If current_sum == target, return [left+1, right+1]
5. **Adjust pointers**: If current_sum < target, increment left; else decrement right
6. **Continue search**: Repeat until target found
7. **Return result**: Return indices of the two numbers

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Two pointers: left at start, right at end
- If sum < target, increment left (need larger value)
- If sum > target, decrement right (need smaller value)
- If sum == target, found pair
- O(n) time single pass, O(1) space, exploits sorted property

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9

Step 1: Initialize pointers
  left = 0 (numbers[0] = 2)
  right = 3 (numbers[3] = 15)

Step 2: First iteration
  current_sum = 2 + 15 = 17
  17 > 9, so move right pointer left
  right = 2

Step 3: Second iteration
  left = 0 (numbers[0] = 2)
  right = 2 (numbers[2] = 11)
  current_sum = 2 + 11 = 13
  13 > 9, so move right pointer left
  right = 1

Step 4: Third iteration
  left = 0 (numbers[0] = 2)
  right = 1 (numbers[1] = 7)
  current_sum = 2 + 7 = 9
  9 == 9 ‚úì Found!

Output: [1, 2] (1-indexed positions)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
