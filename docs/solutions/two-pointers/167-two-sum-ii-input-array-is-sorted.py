### INTUITION:
[This problem requires understanding of two pointers concepts. The key insight is to identify the optimal approach for this specific scenario.]

### APPROACH:
1. **Analyze the problem**: Understand the input constraints and expected output
2. **Choose the right technique**: Apply two pointers methodology
3. **Implement efficiently**: Focus on optimal time and space complexity
4. **Handle edge cases**: Consider boundary conditions and special cases

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- The solution leverages two pointers principles
- Time complexity is optimized for the given constraints
- Space complexity is minimized where possible

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9

Step 1: Initialize pointers
  left = 0 (numbers[0] = 2)
  right = 3 (numbers[3] = 15)

Step 2: First iteration
  current_sum = 2 + 15 = 17
  17 > 9, so move right pointer left
  right = 2

Step 3: Second iteration
  left = 0 (numbers[0] = 2)
  right = 2 (numbers[2] = 11)
  current_sum = 2 + 11 = 13
  13 > 9, so move right pointer left
  right = 1

Step 4: Third iteration
  left = 0 (numbers[0] = 2)
  right = 1 (numbers[1] = 7)
  current_sum = 2 + 7 = 9
  9 == 9 ‚úì Found!

Output: [1, 2] (1-indexed positions)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
