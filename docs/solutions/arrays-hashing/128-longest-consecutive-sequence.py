# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>4 (sequence [1,2,3,4])</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>The longest consecutive sequence [1,2,3,4] has length 4</dd>
</dl>

### INTUITION:
Convert array to a set for O(1) lookups. Only start counting consecutive sequences from numbers where num-1 doesn't exist (the start of a sequence). This avoids redundant counting and achieves O(n) time since each number is visited at most twice.

### APPROACH:
1. **Convert to set**: Create num_set from nums array for O(1) lookup time
2. **Initialize longest streak**: Set longest_streak = 0 to track maximum consecutive sequence length
3. **Iterate through set**: Loop through each number in num_set
4. **Check sequence start**: For each num, verify if (num - 1) exists in set; skip if it does (not a sequence start)
5. **Count consecutive numbers**: When num is a sequence start, initialize current_num = num and current_streak = 1
6. **Extend sequence**: Use while loop to check if (current_num + 1) exists in set, incrementing current_num and current_streak
7. **Update maximum**: Compare current_streak with longest_streak and update longest_streak if current is larger
8. **Return result**: After processing all numbers, return longest_streak

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Set conversion enables O(1) lookups, crucial for checking num-1 and num+1 efficiently
- Only starting from sequence beginnings (where num-1 doesn't exist) prevents redundant counting
- Each number visited at most twice: once in outer loop, once in inner while loop
- This achieves O(n) time despite apparent nested loops - the key insight
- Set takes O(n) space but enables the linear time solution

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]

Step 1: Convert to set
  num_set = {100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2}

Step 2: Check num=1 (no num-1=0 in set, so it's a sequence start)
  current_num = 1, current_streak = 1
  1+1=2 in set ‚Üí current_streak = 2
  2+1=3 in set ‚Üí current_streak = 3
  3+1=4 in set ‚Üí current_streak = 4
  4+1=5 not in set ‚Üí stop
  longest_streak = 4

Step 3: Check num=2 (num-1=1 exists, skip)
Step 4: Check num=3 (num-1=2 exists, skip)
Step 5: Check num=4 (num-1=3 exists, skip)
Step 6: Check num=100 (no num-1=99, sequence start)
  current_streak = 1, no 101 in set
Step 7: Check num=200 (no num-1=199, sequence start)
  current_streak = 1, no 201 in set

Output: 4 (sequence [1,2,3,4])
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
