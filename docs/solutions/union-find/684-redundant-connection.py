# 684. Redundant Connection

In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
This is a classic Union-Find cycle detection problem. In a tree with n nodes, there should be exactly n-1 edges. When we add one extra edge, it creates a cycle. We need to find the edge that completes this cycle.

### APPROACH:
1. **Use Union-Find**: Track connected components as we process edges
2. **Cycle detection**: If two nodes are already connected and we try to add an edge between them, that edge creates a cycle
3. **Return last occurrence**: The problem asks for the edge that occurs last in input if multiple answers exist

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Union-Find efficiently tracks connected components
- When we encounter an edge between two nodes already in the same component, that edge creates a cycle
- The first such edge we encounter (processing left to right) is the redundant one
- This edge can be removed while keeping the graph connected

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]

Process edge [1,2]: 1 and 2 not connected ‚Üí union them
Process edge [1,3]: 1 and 3 not connected ‚Üí union them
Process edge [2,3]: 2 and 3 are already connected through 1 ‚Üí redundant!

Return [2,3]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n √ó Œ±(n))
Where Œ± is the inverse Ackermann function (nearly constant for practical purposes)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(n)
For the Union-Find parent array

### EDGE CASES:
- **[Edge case 1]:** [how it's handled]
- **[Edge case 2]:** [how it's handled]
