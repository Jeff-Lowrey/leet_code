# 130. Surrounded

Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>[["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Surrounded regions: 'X' regions surrounded by 'O' are captured</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Use Union-Find to connect adjacent 'X' cells. For border 'O' cells, connect to virtual border node. After processing, 'O' cells not connected to border should be flipped to 'X'.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize Union-Find**: Create parent array and find/union functions
2. **Connect border Os**: Union all 'O' cells on borders with a dummy border node
3. **Connect internal Os**: Union all adjacent 'O' cells in interior
4. **Identify surrounded**: After unions, check if each 'O' is connected to border
5. **Flip if surrounded**: If 'O' not connected to border, change to 'X'
6. **Keep if connected**: If connected to border, keep as 'O'
7. **Modify in-place**: Update board directly

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Union-find or DFS from borders to mark unsurrounded regions
- Start DFS/BFS from 'O' cells on borders (these can't be surrounded)
- Mark all connected 'O' cells as safe (connected to border)
- Flip all unmarked 'O' to 'X' (these are surrounded)
- O(m*n) time: visit each cell once, O(m*n) space for visited/parent array

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Step 1: Mark border-connected 'O's
  (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) are surrounded
  (3,1) is connected to border

Step 2: Flip surrounded 'O's to 'X'
  Only flip (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)

Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
