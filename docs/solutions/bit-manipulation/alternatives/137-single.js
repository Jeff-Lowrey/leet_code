/**
 * # Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * # 137. Single Number II
 *
 * Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.
 *
 * You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>[2,2,3,2]</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>3 (single number)</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>The single number 3 appears once in [2,2,3,2] (all others appear thrice)</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <details>
 * <summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>
 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * [This problem requires understanding of bit manipulation concepts. The key insight is to identify the optimal approach for this specific scenario.]
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Analyze the problem**: Understand the input constraints and expected output
 * 2. **Choose the right technique**: Apply bit manipulation methodology
 * 3. **Implement efficiently**: Focus on optimal time and space complexity
 * 4. **Handle edge cases**: Consider boundary conditions and special cases
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * - The solution leverages bit manipulation principles
 * - Time complexity is optimized for the given constraints
 * - Space complexity is minimized where possible
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
 * Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
 * Step 1: Count bits at each position
 *   Binary representations:
 *   2 = 010
 *   2 = 010
 *   3 = 011
 *   2 = 010
 *
 *   Bit 0: appears 1 time ‚Üí 1 % 3 = 1
 *   Bit 1: appears 4 times ‚Üí 4 % 3 = 1
 *   Bit 2: appears 0 times ‚Üí 0 % 3 = 0
 *
 * Step 2: Build result from remaining bits
 *   result = 011 (binary) = 3 (decimal)
 *
 * Output: 3 (single number)
 * ```
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(n)
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(1)
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - Empty input handling
 * - Single element cases
 * - Large input considerations
