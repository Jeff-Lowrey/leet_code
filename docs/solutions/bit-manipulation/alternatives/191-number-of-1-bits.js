/**
 * # Difficulty: Easy
 *
 * Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns
 * the number of set bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: n = 11
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The input binary string 1011 has three set bits.
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>n = 11</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>3</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>Number 11 (binary 1011) has 3 set bits</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <details>
 * <summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>
 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * Use bit manipulation to count 1s. The key insight is `n & (n-1)` removes the rightmost
 * set bit, allowing us to count iterations until n becomes 0.
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Brian Kernighan's Algorithm**: n & (n-1) flips rightmost 1-bit to 0
 * 2. **Count iterations**: Each operation removes one 1-bit
 * 3. **Terminate**: When n becomes 0, all 1-bits have been counted
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * n-1 flips all bits after the rightmost 1 (including the 1 itself).
 * AND-ing with n keeps only the bits that were 1 in both, effectively removing that rightmost 1.
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
 * n = 11 (binary: 1011)
 * Count = 0
 *
 * Iteration 1: n = 1011, n-1 = 1010
 * n & (n-1) = 1010, count = 1
 *
 * Iteration 2: n = 1010, n-1 = 1001
 * n & (n-1) = 1000, count = 2
 *
 * Iteration 3: n = 1000, n-1 = 0111
 * n & (n-1) = 0000, count = 3
 *
 * Result: 3
 * ```
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(k) where k is number of 1-bits
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(1)
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - **n = 0**: Return 0 (no 1 bits)
 * - **n = 1**: Return 1 (single 1 bit)
 * - **All bits are 1**: Return 32 for 32-bit integer
 * - **Single bit set**: Return 1
 * - **Power of 2**: Exactly one 1 bit
 *
