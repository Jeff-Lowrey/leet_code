# 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>42 (maximum path sum)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>The maximum path sum is 42 (path: 15->20->7)</dd>
</dl>

### INTUITION:
For each node, max path is: left max path + node + right max path. Recursively calculate max single path from each child. Track global maximum. Return max single path (node + best child path) up.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize max_sum**: Set max_sum = float('-inf')
2. **Define helper**: Implement max_gain(node)
3. **Base case**: If node is None, return 0
4. **Calculate left gain**: left_gain = max(max_gain(node.left), 0)
5. **Calculate right gain**: right_gain = max(max_gain(node.right), 0)
6. **Update global max**: max_sum = max(max_sum, node.val + left_gain + right_gain)
7. **Return path gain**: Return node.val + max(left_gain, right_gain)
8. **Call helper**: max_gain(root), return max_sum

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Post-order DFS: compute max path through each node as potential answer
- Path through node = node.val + max(0, left_path) + max(0, right_path)
- Return to parent: node.val + max(0, left_path, right_path) (single path)
- Track global maximum across all nodes
- O(n) time visiting each node once, O(h) space for recursion

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Step 1: Calculate max path through each node
  Node 15: path=15
  Node 7: path=7
  Node 20: path=20+15+7=42
  Node 9: path=9
  Node -10: path=-10+9+42=41

Output: 42 (maximum path sum)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
