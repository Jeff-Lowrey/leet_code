# 472. Concatenated

Given an array of strings words (without duplicates), return all the concatenated words in the given list of words.

A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses"]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog"]</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Concatenated words are formed by combining other words: 'catsdogcats' = 'cats' + 'dog' + 'cats'</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Build Trie of all words. For each word, DFS from Trie root trying to match it as concatenation of words. Use memoization on position. Word is valid if complete match with 2+ words.

### APPROACH:
1. **Sort by length**: Sort words by length
2. **Build set**: Create word_set from words
3. **Define canForm**: Implement function to check if word can be formed
4. **Use DP**: For each word, use dp[i] = True if word[:i] can be segmented
5. **Check segments**: For each position, try all possible word breaks
6. **Validate**: Word is concatenated if dp[len(word)] is True
7. **Filter results**: Return words that can be formed by concatenation

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Trie stores all words, DFS checks if word can be formed by concatenating
- For each position, try all words that match from that position
- Word is concatenated if formed by >= 2 words (track depth)
- Memoization caches (pos, depth) to avoid recomputing subproblems
- O(n * m * k) time: n words, m avg length, k concatenation attempts

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses"]
Step 1: Check each word
  "catsdogcats" = "cats" + "dog" + "cats" ‚úì
  "dogcatsdog" = "dog" + "cats" + "dog" ‚úì

Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog"]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
