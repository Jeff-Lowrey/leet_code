# 973. K Closest Points To Origin

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., ‚àö(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[[0,1]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"Expected {expected}, got {result}"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>The k=2 closest points to origin are [[1,3],[-2,2]]</dd>

### INTUITION:
Calculate distance for each point. Use max heap (negate distances) of size k. Maintain k closest points. Alternatively, use quickselect for O(n) average time.

### APPROACH:
1. **Calculate distances**: For each point, compute squared distance = x^2 + y^2
2. **Build min heap**: Push (distance, point) tuples to heap
3. **Use heapify**: Or push one by one using heappush
4. **Extract k smallest**: Pop from heap k times
5. **Build result**: For each popped element, add point to result
6. **Return result**: Return list of k closest points

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Max heap of size k: stores (negative distance, point) to get k smallest
- For each point, calculate distance squared (avoid sqrt for efficiency)
- If heap size < k, push; else if distance < heap[0], pop and push
- Negative distance converts min heap to max heap behavior
- O(n log k) time: n points, log k heap operations, O(k) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: points = [[1,3], [-2,2], [5,8], [0,1]], k = 2

Step 1: Calculate distances (squared)
  [1,3]: dist = 1¬≤ + 3¬≤ = 10
  [-2,2]: dist = (-2)¬≤ + 2¬≤ = 8
  [5,8]: dist = 5¬≤ + 8¬≤ = 89
  [0,1]: dist = 0¬≤ + 1¬≤ = 1

Step 2: Build min heap
  heap = [(1, [0,1]), (8, [-2,2]), (10, [1,3]), (89, [5,8])]

Step 3: Extract k=2 smallest
  Pop (1, [0,1]) ‚Üí result = [[0,1]]
  Pop (8, [-2,2]) ‚Üí result = [[0,1], [-2,2]]

Output: [[0,1], [-2,2]]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
