### INTUITION:
[This problem requires understanding of interval concepts. The key insight is to identify the optimal approach for this specific scenario.]

### APPROACH:
1. **Analyze the problem**: Understand the input constraints and expected output
2. **Choose the right technique**: Apply interval methodology
3. **Implement efficiently**: Focus on optimal time and space complexity
4. **Handle edge cases**: Consider boundary conditions and special cases

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- The solution leverages interval principles
- Time complexity is optimized for the given constraints
- Space complexity is minimized where possible

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]]

Step 1: Sort by start time
  Already sorted: [[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]]

Step 2: Initialize with first interval
  merged = [[1,3]]

Step 3: Process [2,6]
  2 ‚â§ 3 (overlaps with [1,3])
  Merge: [1, max(3,6)] = [1,6]
  merged = [[1,6]]

Step 4: Process [8,10]
  8 > 6 (no overlap with [1,6])
  Add new interval
  merged = [[1,6], [8,10]]

Step 5: Process [15,18]
  15 > 10 (no overlap with [8,10])
  Add new interval
  merged = [[1,6], [8,10], [15,18]]

Output: [[1,6], [8,10], [15,18]]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
