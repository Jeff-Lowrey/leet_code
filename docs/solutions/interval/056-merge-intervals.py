# 056. Merge Intervals

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[[1,6]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"Expected {expected}, got {result}"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Merged intervals [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]] become [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Sort intervals by start time. Iterate through sorted intervals. If current overlaps with last merged interval, extend the end. Otherwise add current interval as new merged interval.

### APPROACH:
1. **Sort intervals**: Sort intervals by start time
2. **Initialize result**: Set result = [intervals[0]]
3. **Iterate from second**: For each interval in intervals[1:]
4. **Check overlap**: If current_start <= result[-1][1], intervals overlap
5. **Merge if overlap**: Update result[-1][1] = max(result[-1][1], current_end)
6. **Add if no overlap**: Append current interval to result
7. **Return result**: Return merged intervals

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Sort intervals by start time enables linear merge
- If current.start <= last.end: overlapping, extend last.end to max
- Otherwise: non-overlapping, add to result and update last
- Sorting ensures we never miss overlaps
- O(n log n) for sort, O(n) space for result

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]]

Step 1: Sort by start time
  Already sorted: [[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]]

Step 2: Initialize with first interval
  merged = [[1,3]]

Step 3: Process [2,6]
  2 ‚â§ 3 (overlaps with [1,3])
  Merge: [1, max(3,6)] = [1,6]
  merged = [[1,6]]

Step 4: Process [8,10]
  8 > 6 (no overlap with [1,6])
  Add new interval
  merged = [[1,6], [8,10]]

Step 5: Process [15,18]
  15 > 10 (no overlap with [8,10])
  Add new interval
  merged = [[1,6], [8,10], [15,18]]

Output: [[1,6], [8,10], [15,18]]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
