# Difficulty: Medium

# 646. Maximum Length Of Pair Chain

You are given an array of n pairs pairs where pairs[i] = [lefti, righti] and lefti < righti.

A pair p2 = [c, d] follows a pair p1 = [a, b] if b < c. A chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.

Return the length longest chain which can be formed.

You do not need to use up all the given intervals. You can select pairs in any order.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>pairs = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>2 (maximum chain length)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Longest chain of pairs [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]] is 2</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Sort pairs by end time. Use greedy similar to Activity Selection. Keep previous end, skip pairs that don't start after previous end. Count valid pairs.

### APPROACH:
1. **Sort by end**: Sort pairs by pair[1]
2. **Initialize variables**: Set count = 1, current_end = pairs[0][1]
3. **Iterate from second**: For each pair in pairs[1:]
4. **Check if chainable**: If pair_start > current_end, can extend chain
5. **Extend chain**: Increment count, update current_end = pair_end
6. **Continue processing**: Handle all pairs
7. **Return result**: Return count as maximum chain length

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Sort pairs by end value (second element)
- Greedy: always pick pair with earliest end that doesn't overlap
- If current.start > last.end, add to chain
- Earliest end leaves maximum room for future pairs
- O(n log n) for sort, O(1) space, same logic as activity selection

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: pairs = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Step 1: Sort by second element
  sorted = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]

Step 2: Greedy selection
  Select [1,2], end=2
  [2,3]: 2 ‚â• 2, skip
  [3,4]: 3 > 2, select it, length=2

Output: 2 (maximum chain length)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
