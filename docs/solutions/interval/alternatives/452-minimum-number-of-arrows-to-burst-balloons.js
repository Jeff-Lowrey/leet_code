/**
 * # Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * # 452. Minimum Number Of Arrows To Burst Balloons
 *
 * There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.
 *
 * Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.
 *
 * Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>2 (minimum arrows)</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>Minimum 2 arrows needed to burst balloons at [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]</dd>
 * </dl>

 * <summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>
 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * [This problem requires understanding of interval concepts. The key insight is to identify the optimal approach for this specific scenario.]
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Analyze the problem**: Understand the input constraints and expected output
 * 2. **Choose the right technique**: Apply interval methodology
 * 3. **Implement efficiently**: Focus on optimal time and space complexity
 * 4. **Handle edge cases**: Consider boundary conditions and special cases
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * - The solution leverages interval principles
 * - Time complexity is optimized for the given constraints
 * - Space complexity is minimized where possible
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
 * Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
 * Step 1: Sort by end position
 *   sorted = [[1,6],[2,8],[7,12],[10,16]]
 *
 * Step 2: Greedy arrow placement
 *   Arrow at 6: bursts [1,6],[2,8]
 *   Arrow at 12: bursts [7,12],[10,16]
 *
 * Output: 2 (minimum arrows)
 * ```
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(n)
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(1)
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - Empty input handling
 * - Single element cases
 * - Large input considerations
