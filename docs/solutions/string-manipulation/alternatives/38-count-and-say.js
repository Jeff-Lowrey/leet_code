 *
 * The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:
 * - countAndSay(1) = "1"
 * - countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1),
 *   which is then converted into a different digit string.
 *
 * To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of substrings
 * such that each substring contains exactly one unique digit. Then for each substring,
 * say the number of digits, then say the digit. Finally, concatenate every said digit.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: n = 4
 * Output: "1211"
 * Explanation:
 * countAndSay(1) = "1"
 * countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
 * countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1s = "21"
 * countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "1211"
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>n = 4</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>1211"</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>4th count-and-say term is '1211'</dd>
 * </dl>

 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * The count-and-say sequence is built iteratively where each term describes the previous term
 * by counting consecutive identical digits. We read the previous result from left to right,
 * counting how many times each digit appears consecutively, then building a new string.
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Base Case**: Start with "1" for n=1
 * 2. **Iterative Building**: For each iteration from 2 to n:
 *    - Read through the previous string
 *    - Count consecutive occurrences of each digit
 *    - Build new string by appending count + digit
 * 3. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use two pointers to identify runs of same digits
 * 4. **String Construction**: Use list for efficient string building
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * - Each term is uniquely determined by the previous term
 * - We process left to right, counting consecutive identical digits
 * - The pattern is deterministic and follows a clear rule
 * - Building with a list and joining is efficient in Python
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
 * n = 5:
 * 1. "1"
 * 2. "11" (one 1)
 * 3. "21" (two 1s)
 * 4. "1211" (one 2, one 1)
 * 5. "111221" (one 1, one 2, two 1s)
 *
 * For "1211" ‚Üí "111221":
 * - Read '1' once: "11"
 * - Read '2' once: "12"
 * - Read '1' twice: "21"
 * - Result: "111221"
 * ```
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(n * m)
 * - n iterations to build up to the nth term
 * - m is the length of the string at each iteration (grows exponentially)
 * - Each iteration processes the entire string once
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(m)
 * - m is the length of the current string
 * - We store the result string which grows with each iteration
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - n = 1: Return "1" directly
 * - Long sequences: String grows exponentially
 * - All same digits: Still processed character by character
