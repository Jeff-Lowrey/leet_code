/**
 * # Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm:
 *
 * Begin with an empty string s. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars:
 * - If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.
 * - Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
 *
 * The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead, be stored in the
 * input character array chars. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split
 * into multiple characters in chars.
 *
 * After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.
 *
 * You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
 * Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>Compressed string ['a','a','b','b','c','c','c'] becomes ['a','2','b','2','c','3'] with length 6</dd>
 * </dl>

 * <summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>
 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * We need to compress consecutive identical characters in-place. The key insight is using
 * two pointers: one to read through the array, and one to write the compressed result back
 * to the same array. This allows us to modify the array in-place with O(1) extra space.
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Two Pointers**: Use `read` pointer to scan array, `write` pointer for result
 * 2. **Count Consecutive**: For each character, count how many consecutive times it appears
 * 3. **Write Character**: Always write the character itself
 * 4. **Write Count**: If count > 1, write the count digits
 * 5. **Handle Multi-Digit Counts**: Split counts like 12 into '1', '2'
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * - Writing pointer never overtakes reading pointer (compressed is always shorter)
 * - We process characters left to right in a single pass
 * - In-place modification is safe because we consume input faster than we produce output
 * - Converting count to string and iterating over digits handles multi-digit counts
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
 * Input: ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
 *
 * Read pointer scans:
 * 1. chars[0-1]: 'a' appears 2 times
 *    Write: chars[0]='a', chars[1]='2'
 *    write=2
 *
 * 2. chars[2-3]: 'b' appears 2 times
 *    Write: chars[2]='b', chars[3]='2'
 *    write=4
 *
 * 3. chars[4-6]: 'c' appears 3 times
 *    Write: chars[4]='c', chars[5]='3'
 *    write=6
 *
 * Result: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"] with length 6
 * ```
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(n)
 * - Single pass through the array with read pointer
 * - Writing compressed data is proportional to input size
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(1)
 * - Only using constant extra space (pointers and counters)
 * - Modifying the array in-place
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - Single character: Return 1
 * - All different characters: Return original length
 * - All same characters: Return 1 + len(str(count))
 * - Very long runs (count >= 10): Multi-digit handling
