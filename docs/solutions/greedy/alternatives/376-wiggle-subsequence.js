 * # Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * # 376. Wiggle Subsequence
 *
 * A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>[1,7,4,9,2,5]</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>6 (longest wiggle sequence length)</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>Longest wiggle subsequence in [1,7,4,9,2,5] has length 6</dd>
 * </dl>

 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * [This problem requires understanding of greedy concepts. The key insight is to identify the optimal approach for this specific scenario.]
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Analyze the problem**: Understand the input constraints and expected output
 * 2. **Choose the right technique**: Apply greedy methodology
 * 3. **Implement efficiently**: Focus on optimal time and space complexity
 * 4. **Handle edge cases**: Consider boundary conditions and special cases
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * - The solution leverages greedy principles
 * - Time complexity is optimized for the given constraints
 * - Space complexity is minimized where possible
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
 * Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
 * Step 1: Track direction changes
 *   up = 1, down = 1
 *
 * Step 2: Process each adjacent pair
 *   1‚Üí7: increasing, up = down + 1 = 2
 *   7‚Üí4: decreasing, down = up + 1 = 3
 *   4‚Üí9: increasing, up = down + 1 = 4
 *   9‚Üí2: decreasing, down = up + 1 = 5
 *   2‚Üí5: increasing, up = down + 1 = 6
 *
 * Output: 6 (longest wiggle sequence length)
 * ```
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(n)
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(1)
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - Empty input handling
 * - Single element cases
 * - Large input considerations
