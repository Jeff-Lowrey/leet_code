# Difficulty: Easy

# 720. Longest Word In Dictionary

Given an array of strings words representing an English Dictionary, return the longest word in words that can be built one character at a time by other words in words.

If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no answer, return the empty string.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>["w", "wo", "wor", "worl", "world"]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>1</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Longest word in dictionary built one char at a time is 'world'</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
We need to find the longest word where all its prefixes exist as words in the dictionary. A Trie is perfect for this because we can check if a word can be built character by character by verifying that each intermediate node represents a complete word. DFS or BFS through the trie helps us find the longest buildable word.

### APPROACH:
1. **Build Trie**: Insert all words, marking word ends
2. **DFS/BFS traversal**: Explore trie paths where every node is a word end
3. **Track longest**: Keep track of longest word found
4. **Lexicographic order**: When same length, choose lexicographically smaller
5. **Validate path**: Only continue if current node is a word end

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Trie naturally represents prefix relationships
- Word end markers indicate which prefixes are valid words
- DFS/BFS explores all buildable words systematically
- Path validation ensures all prefixes exist
- Lexicographic ordering handled by trie structure (or sorting)

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
words = ["w","wo","wor","worl","world"]

Build Trie:
  root -> 'w' (word end)
       -> 'o' (word end)
       -> 'r' (word end)
       -> 'l' (word end)
       -> 'd' (word end)

DFS from root:
  Visit 'w' (is word) -> can continue
    Visit 'wo' (is word) -> can continue
      Visit 'wor' (is word) -> can continue
        Visit 'worl' (is word) -> can continue
          Visit 'world' (is word) -> found! length=5

Result: "world" (all prefixes are words)

words = ["a","banana","app","appl","ap","apply","apple"]

Build Trie:
  root -> 'a' (word end)
       -> 'p' (word end)
       -> 'p' (NOT word end) -> can't continue
       -> 'l' (word end)
       -> 'e' (word end) -> "apple" ‚úì
       -> 'y' (word end) -> "apply" ‚úì

Result: "apple" (lexicographically smaller than "apply")
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(N * L)
Where N is number of words, L is average word length
- Building trie: O(N * L)
- DFS traversal: O(N * L)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(N * L)
For trie storage

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty word list
- Single character words
- No buildable words
- Multiple words of same length
- All words are prefixes of each other
