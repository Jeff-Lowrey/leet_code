# 162. Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -‚àû. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[1,2,3,1]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>2 (index of peak element)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Peak element 4 is at index 2 in array [1,2,4,3]</dd>
</dl>

### INTUITION:
A peak must exist because edges are considered smaller. Use binary search: if nums[mid] < nums[mid+1], a peak exists to the right (upward slope); otherwise a peak exists to the left or at mid (downward slope). Always converges to a peak.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize binary search**: Set left = 0, right = len(nums) - 1
2. **Loop until convergence**: While left < right, calculate mid = (left + right) // 2
3. **Compare with neighbor**: Check if nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]
4. **Peak in left half**: If nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1], peak is in left half including mid, set right = mid
5. **Peak in right half**: Otherwise, peak is in right half, set left = mid + 1
6. **Converge to peak**: Continue until left == right
7. **Return peak index**: Return left (or right, they're equal) as the peak element index

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Binary search: if nums[mid] < nums[mid+1], peak must be on right
- If nums[mid] > nums[mid+1], peak on left (mid could be peak)
- Works because adjacent elements are unequal (guaranteed peak exists)
- Doesn't need to check all elements, just finds any peak
- O(log n) time, O(1) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Step 1: Initialize binary search
  left = 0, right = 3

Step 2: Binary search for peak
  mid = 1: nums[1]=2 < nums[2]=3
  ‚Üí Peak is on right, left = 2

  mid = 2: nums[2]=3 > nums[3]=1
  ‚Üí Peak could be at mid or left, right = 2

  left = right = 2

Step 3: Check result
  nums[2] = 3 is greater than neighbors (2 and 1)

Output: 2 (index of peak element)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
