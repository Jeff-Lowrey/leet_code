 * # 875. Koko Eating Bananas
 *
 * Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.
 *
 * Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.
 *
 * Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.
 *
 * Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>4 (minimum eating speed)</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>Minimum eating speed k=4 allows finishing all banana piles within h hours</dd>

 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * [This problem requires understanding of binary search concepts. The key insight is to identify the optimal approach for this specific scenario.]
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Analyze the problem**: Understand the input constraints and expected output
 * 2. **Choose the right technique**: Apply binary search methodology
 * 3. **Implement efficiently**: Focus on optimal time and space complexity
 * 4. **Handle edge cases**: Consider boundary conditions and special cases
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * - The solution leverages binary search principles
 * - Time complexity is optimized for the given constraints
 * - Space complexity is minimized where possible
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
 * Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
 * Step 1: Initialize search space
 *   left = 1 (min speed), right = 11 (max pile size)
 *
 * Step 2: Binary search for minimum speed
 *   mid = 6: hours = ceil(3/6)+ceil(6/6)+ceil(7/6)+ceil(11/6) = 1+1+2+2 = 6 ‚â§ 8
 *   ‚Üí Try lower speed, right = 6
 *
 *   mid = 3: hours = ceil(3/3)+ceil(6/3)+ceil(7/3)+ceil(11/3) = 1+2+3+4 = 10 > 8
 *   ‚Üí Need higher speed, left = 4
 *
 *   mid = 5: hours = ceil(3/5)+ceil(6/5)+ceil(7/5)+ceil(11/5) = 1+2+2+3 = 8 ‚â§ 8
 *   ‚Üí Try lower speed, right = 5
 *
 *   mid = 4: hours = ceil(3/4)+ceil(6/4)+ceil(7/4)+ceil(11/4) = 1+2+2+3 = 8 ‚â§ 8
 *   ‚Üí Try lower speed, right = 4
 *
 *   left = right = 4
 *
 * Output: 4 (minimum eating speed)
 * ```
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(n)
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(1)
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - Empty input handling
 * - Single element cases
 * - Large input considerations
