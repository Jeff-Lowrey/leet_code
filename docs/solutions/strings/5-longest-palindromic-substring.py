# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

This problem demonstrates key concepts in String manipulation and Dynamic Programming.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>"babad"</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"bab" (or "aba")</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Longest palindromic substring is 'bab' or 'aba'</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. To find the longest palindromic substring,
we need to consider that palindromes expand around their center. A key insight is that every
palindrome has a center - either a single character (odd length) or between two characters
(even length). By checking all possible centers, we can find the longest palindrome.

### APPROACH:
1. **Expand around center technique**: For each possible center, expand outwards
2. **Handle both cases**: Check odd-length (single center) and even-length (two centers)
3. **Track maximum**: Keep track of the longest palindrome found so far
4. **Extract substring**: Return the longest palindromic substring at the end

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Every palindrome has a center point
- By expanding from each center, we find all palindromes
- Comparing characters from center outward ensures palindrome property
- Checking all centers guarantees we find the longest one
- This avoids checking all O(n¬≤) substrings explicitly

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: s = "babad"

Centers to check:
- Index 0 ('b'): Expands to "b" (length 1)
- Between 0-1: "ba" not palindrome
- Index 1 ('a'): Expands to "bab" (length 3) ‚úì
- Between 1-2: "ab" not palindrome
- Index 2 ('b'): Expands to "aba" (length 3) ‚úì
- Between 2-3: "ba" not palindrome
- Index 3 ('a'): Expands to "a" (length 1)
- Between 3-4: "ad" not palindrome
- Index 4 ('d'): Expands to "d" (length 1)

Longest found: "bab" or "aba" (both length 3)
Output: "bab" (or "aba")

Input: s = "cbbd"
- Index 1 ('b'): Just "b"
- Between 1-2 ('bb'): Expands to "bb" (length 2) ‚úì
- This is the longest
Output: "bb"
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n¬≤)
There are n possible centers (including between characters), and each expansion can take up to
O(n) time in the worst case. Total: O(n¬≤).

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)
We only store indices and don't create additional data structures proportional to input.
The result substring is extracted at the end.

### EDGE CASES:
- Single character: Return that character
- Empty string: Return empty string
- All same characters: Return entire string
- No palindrome longer than 1: Return first character
- Entire string is palindrome: Return entire string
