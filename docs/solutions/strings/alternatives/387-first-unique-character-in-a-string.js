 * # 387. First Unique Character In A String
 *
 * This problem demonstrates key concepts in Hash Tables and String manipulation.
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>"leetcode"</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>0</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>The first non-repeating character 'l' is at index 2 in 'leetcode'</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <details>
 * <summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>
 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * To find the first unique (non-repeating) character in a string, we need to know the frequency
 * of each character. A character is unique if it appears exactly once. We need to return the index
 * of the first such character when reading left to right.
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Count frequencies**: Build a frequency map of all characters in the string
 * 2. **Find first unique**: Iterate through string again, checking frequency map
 * 3. **Return index**: Return the index of first character with frequency 1
 * 4. **Return -1**: If no unique character exists
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * - Two-pass approach: first pass counts, second pass finds
 * - Hash map provides O(1) lookup for character frequencies
 * - By iterating left to right in second pass, we find the first unique character
 * - This approach is more efficient than checking each character's uniqueness separately
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
 * Input: s = "leetcode"
 * Step 1: Count frequencies: {'l':1, 'e':3, 't':1, 'c':1, 'o':1, 'd':1}
 * Step 2: Check s[0]='l': frequency is 1, found first unique!
 * Output: 0
 *
 * Input: s = "loveleetcode"
 * Step 1: Count frequencies: {'l':2, 'o':2, 'v':1, 'e':4, 't':1, 'c':1, 'd':1}
 * Step 2: Check s[0]='l': frequency is 2, not unique
 * Step 3: Check s[1]='o': frequency is 2, not unique
 * Step 4: Check s[2]='v': frequency is 1, found first unique!
 * Output: 2
 * ```
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(n)
 * We make two passes through the string: one to count (O(n)) and one to find (O(n)).
 * Total is O(2n) = O(n).
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(1)
 * Although we use a hash map, since we're limited to lowercase English letters (26 characters),
 * the space is bounded by a constant. For general character sets, it would be O(k) where k is
 * the character set size.
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - Empty string: Return -1
 * - Single character: Return 0
 * - No unique characters (all repeated): Return -1
 * - All unique characters: Return 0 (first character)
 * - String with only one unique character at the end: Return its index
