# 142. Linked List Cycle Ii

Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Do not modify the linked list.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[3,2,0,-4], pos = 1</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>node 2 (cycle begins here)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>The cycle begins at node with value 2 (index 1)</dd>
</dl>

### INTUITION:
Use Floyd's algorithm: detect cycle with fast/slow pointers. After meeting, reset one pointer to head. Move both one step at a time. They meet at cycle start due to mathematical property of the algorithm.

### APPROACH:
1. **Phase 1 - detect cycle**: Use slow and fast pointers to detect cycle
2. **Move at different speeds**: slow moves 1 step, fast moves 2 steps per iteration
3. **Find meeting point**: If slow == fast, cycle exists; break
4. **No cycle check**: If fast or fast.next is None, return None
5. **Phase 2 - find cycle start**: Reset slow = head, keep fast at meeting point
6. **Move both at same speed**: Move both 1 step at a time
7. **Find cycle entrance**: When slow == fast again, that's the cycle start
8. **Return result**: Return slow as the cycle entrance node

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Floyd's algorithm mathematical property: distance from head to cycle start = distance from meeting point to cycle start
- Phase 1 detects cycle existence by having fast catch up to slow
- Phase 2 exploits the distance property: moving both at same speed from head and meeting point
- They must meet at cycle entrance due to equal distances traveled
- O(n) time with two passes, O(1) space with only two pointers

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Step 1: Detect cycle
  slow and fast meet at -4

Step 2: Find cycle start
  slow=3, slow2=3
  slow=2, slow2=2 ‚Üí both at cycle start

Output: node 2 (cycle begins here)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
