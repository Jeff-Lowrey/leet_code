# 023. Merge K Sorted Lists

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Merging [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]] gives [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Use min heap containing (value, list_index, node). Pop minimum, add to result, push next node from same list. Repeat until heap empty. Creates merged sorted list from k lists.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize min heap**: Create empty heap to track smallest available nodes
2. **Add first nodes**: For each list, push (head.val, index, head) to heap if head exists
3. **Create dummy head**: Initialize dummy = ListNode(0) and current = dummy
4. **Pop minimum repeatedly**: While heap is not empty, heappop to get smallest node
5. **Append to result**: Set current.next = popped_node, advance current
6. **Push next node**: If popped_node.next exists, heappush it to heap
7. **Continue until empty**: Repeat until heap is empty (all nodes processed)
8. **Return result**: Return dummy.next as head of merged list

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Min heap always gives us the smallest available node across all k lists in O(log k) time
- Heap maintains size ‚â§ k by replacing popped nodes with their successors
- Dummy node simplifies edge cases (empty lists, single element)
- Total time: O(N log k) where N is total nodes, since each node inserted/removed once
- Space: O(k) for heap, not O(N), making it efficient for large lists

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Step 1: Add all heads to min heap
  heap = [(1,0), (1,1), (2,2)]

Step 2: Extract minimum and add next node
  Pop (1,0), add 4 from list 0
  Pop (1,1), add 3 from list 1
  Pop (2,2), add 6 from list 2
  Continue until heap empty

Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
