# 206. Reverse Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → null</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → null</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>The list is reversed so that the last node becomes the first: 5->4->3->2->1</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>🔍 SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Track previous node. For each node, change next pointer to previous. Move forward by saving next before changing pointers. Return previous when current is null.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize pointers**: Set prev = None, current = head
2. **Iterate until end**: While current is not None
3. **Save next node**: next_node = current.next to avoid losing reference
4. **Reverse link**: current.next = prev to point backwards
5. **Move prev forward**: prev = current
6. **Move current forward**: current = next_node
7. **Return new head**: After loop, return prev as new head

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Three-pointer technique (prev, current, next) enables reversal without extra space
- Saving next pointer before reversing prevents losing rest of list
- Each node's next pointer flipped exactly once as we traverse
- When current becomes null, prev points to new head (original tail)
- O(n) time single pass, O(1) space using only three pointers

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → null

Step 1: Initialize
  prev = null
  current = 1

Step 2: Process node 1
  next_temp = 2
  1.next = null
  prev = 1, current = 2
  Result: null ← 1   2 → 3 → 4 → 5

Step 3: Process node 2
  next_temp = 3
  2.next = 1
  prev = 2, current = 3
  Result: null ← 1 ← 2   3 → 4 → 5

Step 4: Process node 3
  next_temp = 4
  3.next = 2
  prev = 3, current = 4
  Result: null ← 1 ← 2 ← 3   4 → 5

Step 5: Process node 4
  next_temp = 5
  4.next = 3
  prev = 4, current = 5
  Result: null ← 1 ← 2 ← 3 ← 4   5

Step 6: Process node 5
  next_temp = null
  5.next = 4
  prev = 5, current = null
  Result: null ← 1 ← 2 ← 3 ← 4 ← 5

Output: 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → null
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
