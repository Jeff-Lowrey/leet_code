## Technical Details

### CSS Variables

All themes use CSS custom properties (variables) for easy customization:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #5b7bb5;
    --secondary-color: #6b7280;
    --dark-bg: #111827;
    --light-bg: #f5f5f0;
    --card-bg: #fdfdfc;
    --text-primary: #1a1a1a;
    --text-secondary: #4a4a4a;
    --border-color: #e0e0dc;
    --card-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);

    /* Category-specific colors */
    --cat-rust: #d47d5e;
    --cat-steel-blue: #6890c9;
    --cat-sage: #7fa87f;
    /* ... more categories ... */
}
```

### Theme Application

Themes are applied using the `data-theme` attribute:

```html
<html data-theme="neon-dark">
```

JavaScript handles theme switching and persistence:

```javascript
// Save theme preference
localStorage.setItem('theme', 'neon-dark');

// Load saved theme on page load
const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', savedTheme);
```

### Browser Compatibility

Themes work on all modern browsers:
- ‚úÖ Chrome 49+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 31+
- ‚úÖ Safari 9.1+
- ‚úÖ Edge 15+

CSS custom properties are widely supported and provide instant theme switching without page reload.

## Tips for Theme Usage

### Finding Your Preference

1. **Try Multiple Themes**: Experiment with different themes over several days
2. **Match Your Environment**: Choose themes that work with your lighting
3. **Consider Time of Day**: Switch between light and dark modes as needed
4. **Accessibility First**: If you have visual needs, prioritize High Contrast

### Performance

- ‚úÖ Theme switching is instant (no page reload)
- ‚úÖ No performance impact (pure CSS)
- ‚úÖ Works offline (localStorage)
- ‚úÖ No network requests needed

### Troubleshooting

**Theme not saving?**
- Check browser localStorage is enabled
- Ensure cookies/storage not blocked
- Try clearing browser cache

**Colors look wrong?**
- Verify you selected correct theme variant (light vs dark)
- Check browser zoom level (100% recommended)
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)

**Theme selector missing?**
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you're using a supported browser

## Contributing New Themes

Developers can add new themes by:

1. Adding CSS variables in `static/css/themes.css`
2. Following the existing theme structure
3. Providing both light and dark variants
4. Testing for readability and contrast
5. Documenting the theme purpose

See the [Developer Guide](../developer-guide/05-static-files.md) for technical details on theme implementation.
