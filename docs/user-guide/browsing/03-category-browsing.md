## Home Page Categories

### Category Cards

The home page displays all 29+ algorithmic categories as visual cards with helpful metadata:

- **Category Name**: Clear identification of the algorithmic pattern
- **Solution Count**: Number of problems solved in that category
- **Difficulty Badges**: Color-coded breakdown (🟢 Easy, 🟡 Medium, 🔴 Hard) showing distribution
- **Complexity Badges**: Top 3 complexity patterns in the category (e.g., "O(n): 15 | O(n²): 8")
- **Color Coding**: Each category has a unique color for easy recognition
- **Quick Access Dropdown**: Direct navigation to specific problems

**Badge Features:**
- **Difficulty Breakdown**: See at a glance how many Easy, Medium, and Hard problems are in each category
- **Complexity Patterns**: Understand the common time/space complexity patterns in the category
- **Dynamic Loading**: Badges load automatically when you visit the home page
- **Smart Filtering**: Badges exclude "Unknown" complexity and show "Other" for less common patterns
