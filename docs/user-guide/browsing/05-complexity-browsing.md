## Table of Contents

- [Complexity Overview Page](#complexity-overview-page)
- [Complexity Sections](#complexity-sections)
- [Using Complexity View](#using-complexity-view)

## Complexity Overview Page

View all problems organized by their time and space complexity combinations:

**Accessing:**
- Use the "View By" dropdown and select "By Complexity"
- Or navigate directly to `/complexity`

**Page Features:**
- All complexity combinations in one view
- Sorted by frequency (most common first)
- Collapsible sections for each combination
- Problem count for each complexity level
- TOC sidebar with jump links

## Complexity Sections

Each complexity section shows:

**Section Header:**
- Time complexity (e.g., O(n), O(log n), O(n²))
- Space complexity (e.g., O(1), O(n))
- Combined format: "Time: O(n) | Space: O(1)"
- Problem count for this combination
- Expandable/collapsible arrow

**Problem Cards:**
- Problem number and title
- Category label
- Difficulty level
- Click to view solution

**Common Complexity Combinations:**
- **O(n) | O(1)**: Linear time, constant space (very common)
- **O(n log n) | O(1)**: Sorting algorithms
- **O(n) | O(n)**: Hash table solutions
- **O(log n) | O(1)**: Binary search
- **O(n²) | O(1)**: Nested loops

**Clickable Badges:**
- Complexity badges on solution pages link to complexity overview
- Click to see all problems with that time/space combination
- Automatically jumps to the relevant section

## Using Complexity View

**For Learning:**
1. Study problems with the same complexity together
2. Compare different approaches to achieve same complexity
3. Understand space-time tradeoffs

**For Optimization:**
1. Find problems with optimal O(n) or O(log n) solutions
2. Study constant space O(1) techniques
3. Compare your solution's complexity to others
