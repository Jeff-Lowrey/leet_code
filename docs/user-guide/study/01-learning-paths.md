## Overview

Structured approaches for different goals and skill levels. Choose the path that matches your current experience and objectives.

## For Complete Beginners

### Week 1-2: Fundamentals

**Focus Areas:**
- Arrays & Hashing (Easy problems)
- Two Pointers (Easy problems)
- Basic string manipulation

**Study Plan:**
1. **Day 1-3**: Arrays & Hashing basics
   - Two Sum
   - Contains Duplicate
   - Valid Anagram
2. **Day 4-7**: Two Pointers introduction
   - Valid Palindrome
   - Two Sum II
   - Remove Duplicates
3. **Week 2**: Practice and reinforce
   - Solve 2-3 problems daily
   - Review previous solutions
   - Focus on understanding, not speed

**Learning Strategy:**
- Read solution first, understand fully
- Implement yourself from memory
- Compare your code with reference
- Focus on patterns, not memorization

### Month 1: Core Data Structures

**Categories to Master:**
1. **Arrays & Hashing** (Week 1-2)
2. **Two Pointers** (Week 2-3)
3. **Stacks** (Week 3-4)
4. **Sliding Window** (Week 4)

**Daily Routine:**
- **Morning**: Study 1 new problem (30-45 min)
- **Afternoon**: Review yesterday's problem (15 min)
- **Evening**: Practice similar problem (30 min)

**Success Metrics:**
- Can explain approach for each problem
- Can implement from scratch
- Recognize patterns in new problems
- Complete Easy problems in 15-20 min

## For Interview Preparation
