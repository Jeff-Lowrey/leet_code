## Active Recall

**Don't Just Read:**
1. **Read Problem**: Understand requirements
2. **Close Browser**: Try solving mentally
3. **Sketch Solution**: Pseudocode on paper
4. **Implement**: Code your solution
5. **Compare**: Check against reference
6. **Re-implement**: Code again from memory

## Spaced Repetition

**Review Schedule:**
- **Day 1**: Solve problem
- **Day 3**: Solve again from scratch
- **Week 1**: Review and re-solve
- **Week 2**: Final review
- **Month 1**: Spot check

**Track Progress:**
```
Problem Log:
- 001 Two Sum: Day 1 ✓, Day 3 ✓, Week 1 ✓
- 217 Contains Duplicate: Day 1 ✓, Day 3 ✓
```

## Deliberate Practice

**Focus on Weaknesses:**

1. **Identify Gaps**: Which patterns struggle?
2. **Focused Study**: Extra time on weak areas
3. **Multiple Problems**: Same pattern repeatedly
4. **Track Improvement**: Measure progress
5. **Iterate**: Keep refining

**Example:**
```
Struggle: Dynamic Programming
Action:
- Study DP theory
- Solve 15 Easy DP problems
- 10 Medium DP problems
- Daily DP practice for 2 weeks
Result: DP becomes strength
```

## Learning from Mistakes

**After Each Problem:**

1. **What Worked?**
   - Correct intuition
   - Good initial approach
   - Effective debugging

2. **What Didn't?**
   - Wrong approach
   - Missed edge cases
   - Optimization missed

3. **What Learned?**
   - New pattern
   - Better technique
   - Common mistake

4. **How to Improve?**
   - Study similar problems
   - Review fundamentals
   - Practice more
