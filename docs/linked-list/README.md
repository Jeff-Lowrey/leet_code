# Linked List

## Category Overview

Pointer manipulation and list traversal problems.

## Common Patterns

- **Reversal**
- **Fast/Slow Pointers**
- **Merge Operations**
- **Cycle Detection**

## Complexity Analysis

O(n) time with O(1) or O(n) space

## Key Techniques

Understanding these patterns will help you recognize and solve similar problems efficiently.

## Tips for Success

1. Practice recognizing the pattern in the problem statement
2. Start with a brute force approach, then optimize
3. Consider edge cases and constraints
4. Think about time and space tradeoffs
5. Review similar problems to reinforce patterns

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Not considering all edge cases
2. Off-by-one errors in indices
3. Forgetting to handle empty inputs
4. Inefficient nested loops that can be optimized
5. Not utilizing the specific properties of the data structure
