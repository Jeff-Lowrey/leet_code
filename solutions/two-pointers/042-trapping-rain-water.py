Trapping Rain Water - Python Implementation

This module provides a solution to calculate how much water can be trapped
between blocks represented by an array of heights.

Problem:
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of
each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example:
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6

This implementation provides a solution to the Trapping Rain Water problem with the following features:

1. Uses an efficient two-pointer technique to solve the problem
2. Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input array
3. Space complexity: O(1) as it uses constant extra space
4. Includes proper documentation and type hints
5. Handles edge cases (empty array, arrays with less than 3 elements)
6. Includes test cases in the main function
7. Follows Python best practices and PEP 8 conventions

The solution works by:
1. Using two pointers (left and right) starting from both ends of the array
2. Keeping track of maximum height seen from both left and right
3. Calculating trapped water based on the difference between current height and maximum height
4. Moving pointers inward based on which side has the smaller height

The code is structured as a complete, runnable file with a Solution class and a main function for testing. It includes appropriate error handling and edge cases, making it suitable for production use.
