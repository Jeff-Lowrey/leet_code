# 042. Trapping Rain Water

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>6 (total water trapped)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Rain water trapped between heights [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1] is 6 units</dd>
</dl>

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
For each position, calculate trapped water = min(max_left, max_right) - height. Use two pointers from both ends. Track max heights seen. Move pointer with smaller max height inward.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize pointers**: Set left = 0, right = len(height) - 1
2. **Track max heights**: Set left_max = 0, right_max = 0
3. **Initialize water count**: Set water = 0
4. **Loop while left < right**: Continue until pointers meet
5. **Process shorter side**: If height[left] < height[right], process left
6. **Update max and water**: If height[left] >= left_max, update left_max; else add (left_max - height[left]) to water
7. **Move pointer**: Increment left or decrement right based on which side processed
8. **Return result**: Return water as total trapped water

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Water level at any position determined by min(left_max, right_max) - height
- Two pointers work inward from edges tracking max heights seen so far
- Process side with smaller max first: its water amount is already determined by the smaller max
- Other side's larger max guarantees it won't limit water on current side
- Single pass O(n) time replaces two-pass array approach, O(1) space instead of O(n)

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Step 1: Calculate max heights
  left_max = [0,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3]
  right_max = [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,1]

Step 2: Calculate water at each position
  i=2: min(1,3)-0 = 1
  i=4: min(2,3)-1 = 1
  i=5: min(2,3)-0 = 2
  ...

Output: 6 (total water trapped)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
