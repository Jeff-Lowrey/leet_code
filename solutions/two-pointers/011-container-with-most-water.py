I'll help you create a solution for the Container With Most Water problem. Here's the implementation:

Container With Most Water - Python Implementation

Problem: Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point 
at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the 
line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis 
forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

This implementation includes:

1. A clear docstring explaining the problem and complexity
2. Type hints using the typing module
3. A Solution class with the main implementation
4. The two-pointer technique for optimal solution
5. Comprehensive test cases
6. Main execution block with example usage
7. Clear comments explaining the logic
8. Proper error handling and edge cases
9. Following Python PEP 8 style guidelines

The solution uses the two-pointer technique to achieve O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. It works by:

1. Starting with two pointers at the ends of the array
2. Calculating the area between the lines at these pointers
3. Moving the pointer with the smaller height inward
4. Keeping track of the maximum area seen so far

The implementation includes test cases covering various scenarios including:
- Regular case with multiple heights
- Minimum case with just two heights
- Case with all same heights
- Case with increasing heights
- Empty array case
