# 011. Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>49</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Maximum water container area is 49 with heights [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Use two pointers from both ends. Calculate area = min(height[left], height[right]) * width. Move pointer with smaller height inward (moving taller pointer can't increase area). Track maximum.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize pointers**: Set left = 0, right = len(height) - 1
2. **Initialize max area**: Set max_area = 0
3. **Loop while left < right**: Continue until pointers meet
4. **Calculate area**: area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
5. **Update maximum**: max_area = max(max_area, area)
6. **Move pointer**: If height[left] < height[right], increment left; else decrement right
7. **Return result**: Return max_area as maximum water container

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Two pointers: left at start, right at end
- Area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
- Move pointer with shorter height: taller height won't improve area until we find taller opposite
- Track maximum area seen
- O(n) time: single pass, O(1) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]

Step 1: Initialize
  left = 0 (height=1), right = 8 (height=7)
  max_area = 0

Step 2: First iteration
  width = 8 - 0 = 8
  min_height = min(1, 7) = 1
  area = 8 √ó 1 = 8
  max_area = 8
  Move left pointer (smaller height)
  left = 1

Step 3: left=1 (height=8), right=8 (height=7)
  width = 8 - 1 = 7
  min_height = min(8, 7) = 7
  area = 7 √ó 7 = 49
  max_area = 49
  Move right pointer (smaller height)
  right = 7

Step 4: left=1 (height=8), right=7 (height=3)
  width = 7 - 1 = 6
  min_height = min(8, 3) = 3
  area = 6 √ó 3 = 18
  max_area = 49 (no change)
  Move right pointer
  right = 6

Step 5: Continue until left >= right...

Output: 49
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
