I'll help you create a solution for the Remove Element problem. I'll write a clean, well-commented implementation that follows Python best practices.

"""
LeetCode Problem: Remove Element
Given an integer array nums and a value val, remove all instances of val in-place 
and return the new length. The order of elements can be changed.

```

This implementation includes:

1. A clear solution class with the `removeElement` method that modifies the array in-place
2. Proper type hints using the `typing` module
3. Comprehensive docstrings explaining the functionality and complexity
4. A test function with multiple test cases to verify the solution
5. Clean code structure following PEP 8 guidelines
6. Edge case handling (empty array, single element, etc.)
7. Main guard to allow for both import and direct execution

The solution uses a two-pointer approach to modify the array in-place, which is efficient and meets the space complexity requirement of O(1). The time complexity is O(n) as we need to traverse the array once.

When you run this file, it will execute the test cases and show the results for each test case, including the input array, value to remove, expected length, actual length, and the modified array's relevant elements.
