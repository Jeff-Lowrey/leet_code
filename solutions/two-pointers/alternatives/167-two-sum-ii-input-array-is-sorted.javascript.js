I'll help you create a solution for the Two Sum II problem in JavaScript. I'll write a complete implementation that meets all the requirements.

```javascript
/**
 * Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
 * 
 * Problem: Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order,
 * find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
 * Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array.
 * 
 * The solution must use only constant extra space and the input array is 1-indexed.
 * 
 * @param {number[]} numbers - The input array of integers (sorted in non-decreasing order)
 * @param {number} target - The target sum to find
 * @return {number[]} - Array containing the 1-indexed positions of the two numbers
 */
function twoSum(numbers, target) {
    // Input validation
    if (!Array.isArray(numbers) || numbers.length < 2) {
        throw new Error('Invalid input array');
    }

    // Initialize two pointers: left at start and right at end
    let left = 0;
    let right = numbers.length - 1;

    // Continue until pointers meet
    while (left < right) {
        const currentSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];

        if (currentSum === target) {
            // Found the pair, return 1-indexed positions
            return [left + 1, right + 1];
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            // Sum is too small, move left pointer right
            left++;
        } else {
            // Sum is too large, move right pointer left
            right--;
        }
    }

    // No solution found
    return [];
}

/**
 * Test cases to verify the implementation
 */
function runTests() {
    // Test case 1: Basic case
    console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Expected: [1, 2]

    // Test case 2: Numbers in middle
    console.log(twoSum([2, 3, 4], 6)); // Expected: [1, 3]

    // Test case 3: Adjacent numbers
    console.log(twoSum([1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 9, 56, 90], 8)); // Expected: [4, 5]

    // Test case 4: Negative numbers
    console.log(twoSum([-1, 0], -1)); // Expected: [1, 2]
}

// Export the function for use in other modules
module.exports = twoSum;

// Run tests if this file is being run directly
if (require.main === module) {
    runTests();
}
```

This implementation includes:

1. A well-documented main function `twoSum` that solves the Two Sum II problem
2. Input validation to handle edge cases
3. An efficient two-pointer approach that takes advantage of the sorted array
4. Test cases to verify the implementation
5. Proper exports for module usage
6. Clear comments explaining the implementation
7. Follows JavaScript best practices and conventions

The solution uses the two-pointer technique which is optimal for this problem because:
- It takes advantage of the sorted nature of the input array
- Uses constant extra space (O(1) space complexity)
- Achieves linear time complexity (O(n))

The implementation handles various cases including:
- Basic cases
- Numbers in the middle of the array
- Adjacent numbers
- Negative numbers
- Edge cases through input validation

The code is structured as a complete, runnable file that can be both imported as a module and run directly for testing.
