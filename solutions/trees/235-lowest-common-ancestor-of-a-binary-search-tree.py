# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
**Medium**

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
In a BST, we can leverage the ordering property to find LCA efficiently. If both nodes are smaller than current node, LCA is in left subtree. If both are larger, LCA is in right subtree. Otherwise, current node is the LCA.

### APPROACH:
1. **Use BST property**: Left subtree < root < right subtree
2. **Compare values**: If both p and q < root, go left; if both > root, go right
3. **Find split point**: When p and q are on different sides, current node is LCA
4. **Handle edge cases**: One node is ancestor of the other

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- BST ordering allows us to determine which subtree contains the LCA
- The first node where p and q diverge (different subtrees) is the LCA
- If one node equals current node, current node is the LCA
- This is much more efficient than general tree LCA algorithms

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(h)
Where h is the height of the tree. O(log n) for balanced BST, O(n) for skewed tree

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(h)
For recursion stack, O(1) for iterative solution

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
BST:      6
         / \
        2   8
       / \ / \
      0  4 7  9
        / \
       3   5

Find LCA of 2 and 8:
1. Start at 6: 2 < 6 and 8 > 6, so 6 is LCA
Output: 6

Find LCA of 2 and 4:
1. Start at 6: 2 < 6 and 4 < 6, go left
2. At 2: 2 == 2 (found p), so 2 is LCA
Output: 2
```

### KEY INSIGHTS:
- BST property makes LCA finding O(h) instead of O(n)
- No need to search entire tree like in general binary tree
- Can be solved iteratively or recursively
- Works even when one node is ancestor of the other
