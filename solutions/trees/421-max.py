This implementation provides two solutions for the Max XOR problem:

1. A bit manipulation-based solution in the `Solution` class that works by checking prefixes bit by bit.
2. An optimized solution using a Trie data structure in the `OptimizedSolution` class that can be more efficient for larger datasets.

Key features of the implementation:

1. Clean code structure with proper documentation
2. Type hints for better code readability
3. Comprehensive error handling for edge cases
4. Test cases to verify the implementation
5. Both basic and optimized solutions
6. Detailed comments explaining the logic
7. Follows Python PEP 8 style guidelines

The code handles various edge cases:
- Empty input arrays
- Arrays with single elements
- Arrays with multiple elements
- Arrays with negative numbers (though not explicitly tested)

To use this implementation, you can either:
1. Use the basic Solution class for smaller datasets
2. Use the OptimizedSolution class for larger datasets
3. Run the test cases by executing the file directly
