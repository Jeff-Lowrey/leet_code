Max Path Sum - Python Implementation
Finding the maximum path sum in a binary tree.

A path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node
in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least
one node and does not need to go through the root.

This implementation includes:

1. A `TreeNode` class to define the binary tree structure
2. A `Solution` class with the main `maxPathSum` method
3. A helper function `max_gain` that does the recursive calculation
4. Test cases to verify the implementation
5. Proper handling of edge cases including negative values
6. Clear comments explaining the logic and approach

The solution uses a recursive approach to:
- Calculate the maximum path sum that can include each node
- Track the global maximum path sum
- Handle cases where we might want to exclude negative paths
- Consider paths that don't necessarily go through the root

The time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node exactly once. The space complexity is O(H) where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack.

The test cases demonstrate the solution works for both simple trees and more complex cases with negative values.
