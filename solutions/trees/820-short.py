# 820. Short Encoding of Words

A valid encoding of an array of words is any reference string s and an array of indices indices such that:
- words.length == indices.length
- The reference string s ends with the character '#'
- For each index indices[i], the substring of s starting at indices[i] and ending at the next '#' is equal to words[i]

Given an array of words, return the length of the shortest reference string s possible of any valid encoding of words.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[input description]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>[output description]</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>[explanation]</dd>

### INTUITION:
To minimize the encoding length, we want to share suffixes between words. If one word is a suffix of another, we can encode both using just the longer word. This is a classic Trie problem where we build the trie using word suffixes.

### APPROACH:
1. **Trie Construction**: Build a trie using the reverse of each word (to handle suffixes)
2. **Deduplication**: Remove words that are suffixes of other words
3. **Length Calculation**: For each unique word, add its length + 1 (for '#') to the total

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Trie naturally handles prefix/suffix relationships
- By reversing words, we can detect when one word is a suffix of another
- Only leaf nodes in the trie represent words that need their own encoding
- Each word needs one '#' delimiter, so total length = sum(word_lengths) + count

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: words = ["time", "me", "bell"]
1. Build trie with reversed words: ["emit", "em", "lleb"]
2. "em" is a suffix of "emit", so we can share encoding
3. Result: "time#bell#" (length 10)
   - "time" at index 0
   - "me" at index 2 (suffix of "time")
   - "bell" at index 5
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(N √ó M)
Where N is the number of words and M is the average length of words

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(N √ó M)
For the trie structure and set storage

### EDGE CASES:
- **[Edge case 1]:** [how it's handled]
- **[Edge case 2]:** [how it's handled]
