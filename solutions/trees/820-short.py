I'll help you create a solution for the Short Encoding implementation in Python. I'll create a clean, well-documented solution that follows Python best practices.

Short Encoding Implementation

This implementation provides a complete solution for short encoding with the following features:

1. Clean, well-structured code following Python conventions
2. Proper type hints and documentation
3. Comprehensive error handling and edge cases
4. Two main methods:
   - `minimum_length_encoding`: Calculates the minimum length needed
   - `encode_words`: Creates the actual encoded string
5. Main function with test cases
6. Proper class structure and organization

The solution handles cases where:
- Words are suffixes of other words
- Duplicate words exist
- Empty input is provided
- Single word input is provided

The code is efficient and uses sets for better performance when checking for duplicates and suffix relationships. It's also well-documented with docstrings and comments explaining the implementation details.

To use this code, you can simply run it as a script, or import the ShortEncoding class and use it in your own code. The main function provides examples of how to use the implementation with various test cases.
