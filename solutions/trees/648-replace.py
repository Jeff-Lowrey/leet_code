# Difficulty: Medium

# 648. Replace

In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word derivative. For example, when the root "help" is followed by the word "ful", we can form a derivative "helpful".

Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the derivatives in the sentence with the root forming it. If a derivative can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.

Return the sentence after the replacement.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"the cat was rat by the bat"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Words are replaced by their shortest root: 'cattle' becomes 'cat', 'ratt' becomes 'rat'</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Build Trie of dictionary words. For each word in sentence, find shortest prefix in Trie. If found, replace with shortest; otherwise keep original word.

### APPROACH:
1. **Build trie**: Insert all dictionary words into trie
2. **Define findRoot**: Implement function to find shortest root for a word
3. **Traverse trie**: For each character in word, follow trie path
4. **Found root**: If reach end of word in trie, return prefix
5. **No root**: If path breaks or no root found, return original word
6. **Process sentence**: Split sentence, replace each word using findRoot
7. **Return result**: Join replaced words with spaces

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Trie stores dictionary roots, replace words with shortest matching root
- For each word in sentence, search trie while traversing characters
- Stop at first matching root (shortest prefix that's a complete word)
- If no root found, keep original word
- O(m + n*k) time: m total dict length, n words in sentence, k avg word length

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Step 1: Build trie from dictionary
  Insert: cat, bat, rat

Step 2: Replace each word with shortest root
  "cattle" ‚Üí "cat"
  "rattled" ‚Üí "rat"
  "battery" ‚Üí "bat"

Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
