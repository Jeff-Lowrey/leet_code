Concatenated Words Implementation

This module provides a solution for finding concatenated words in a given list of words.
A concatenated word is a word that can be formed by concatenating other words from the same list.

This implementation includes:

1. A clean, well-structured solution using a class-based approach
2. Proper type hints and documentation
3. Efficient algorithm using dynamic programming with memoization
4. Helper function for recursive word formation checking
5. Edge case handling
6. Example test cases in the main function
7. Clear comments explaining the implementation
8. Following Python best practices and PEP 8 conventions

The solution uses a dynamic programming approach with memoization to efficiently check if a word can be formed by concatenating other words from the list. The main algorithm:

1. Converts the word list to a set for O(1) lookup
2. For each word, checks if it can be formed by concatenating other words
3. Uses a recursive helper function with memoization to avoid redundant calculations
4. Handles edge cases like empty lists and empty strings
5. Returns the list of concatenated words found

The time complexity is O(n * l^2) where n is the number of words and l is the average length of words. The space complexity is O(n) for the word set and memoization dictionary.
