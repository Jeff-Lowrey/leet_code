I'll help you implement a solution for the Kth Largest Stream problem in Python. This implementation will use a min-heap to efficiently maintain the k largest elements in the stream.

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class KthLargest:
    """
    A class to find the kth largest element in a stream of numbers.
    Uses a min-heap to maintain k largest elements.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        """
        Initialize the KthLargest object with the given k and initial array.
        
        Args:
            k (int): The k value for kth largest element
            nums (List[int]): Initial array of numbers
        """
        self.k = k
        self.min_heap = []
        
        # Add initial numbers to the heap
        for num in nums:
            self.add(num)
            
    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        """
        Adds a new value to the stream and returns the kth largest element.
        
        Args:
            val (int): New value to add to the stream
            
        Returns:
            int: The kth largest element after adding the new value
        """
        # If heap size is less than k, simply add the element
        if len(self.min_heap) < self.k:
            heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, val)
        # If new value is larger than smallest value in heap, remove smallest and add new value
        elif val > self.min_heap[0]:
            heapq.heapreplace(self.min_heap, val)
            
        # Return kth largest element (top of min-heap)
        return self.min_heap[0] if len(self.min_heap) >= self.k else None


def main():
    """
    Example usage and test cases for KthLargest class
    """
    # Test Case 1
    k = 3
    nums = [4, 5, 8, 2]
    kth_largest = KthLargest(k, nums)
    
    # Test adding numbers and getting kth largest
    test_cases = [3, 5, 10, 9, 4]
    print(f"Initial array: {nums}, k={k}")
    
    for num in test_cases:
        result = kth_largest.add(num)
        print(f"After adding {num}, kth largest is: {result}")
    
    # Test Case 2
    k = 2
    nums = [0]
    kth_largest2 = KthLargest(k, nums)
    
    test_cases2 = [-1, 1, -2, -4, 3]
    print(f"\nInitial array: {nums}, k={k}")
    
    for num in test_cases2:
        result = kth_largest2.add(num)
        print(f"After adding {num}, kth largest is: {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation includes:

1. A `KthLargest` class that maintains a min-heap of the k largest elements
2. An `__init__` method to initialize the object with a given k and initial array
3. An `add` method to add new elements to the stream and return the kth largest
4. A `main` function with example usage and test cases
5. Proper type hints and documentation
6. Efficient use of Python's heapq module for heap operations

The solution uses a min-heap to maintain only the k largest elements, which provides efficient O(log k) operations for adding new elements and finding the kth largest element.

Key features:
- Space Complexity: O(k) where k is the specified value for kth largest
- Time Complexity: O(log k) for add operations
- Handles edge cases appropriately
- Includes comprehensive comments and documentation
- Follows Python best practices and PEP 8 conventions

The code can be run directly to see example usage with test cases, or the `KthLargest` class can be imported and used in other code.
