# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency
# Difficulty: Medium
Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters.
The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
We need to count character frequencies and then sort characters by their frequency
in descending order. This is a classic use case for heaps/priority queues combined
with hash maps for counting.

### APPROACH:
1. **Count frequencies**: Use hash map to count each character
2. **Sort by frequency**: Use heap or simple sorting to order by frequency
3. **Build result**: Reconstruct string with characters in frequency order

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Hash map provides O(1) character frequency counting
- Heap/sorting organizes characters by frequency efficiently
- Multiple characters can appear in any order at same frequency

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n log k)
Where n is string length, k is number of unique characters

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(k)
For storing character frequencies and heap

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: s = "tree"
Step 1: Count frequencies: {'t': 1, 'r': 1, 'e': 2}
Step 2: Sort by frequency: [('e', 2), ('t', 1), ('r', 1)]
Step 3: Build result: "eert" (or "eetr")
```

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty string: return empty
- Single character: return as-is
- All characters same frequency: any order valid
