# 692. Top K Frequent Words

Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.

Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[3, 2]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"Expected {expected}, got {result}"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Top k=2 frequent words in ['i','love','leetcode','i','love','coding'] are ['i','love']</dd>
</dl>

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
This problem combines frequency counting with sorting. We need to find the k most frequent words, but with a twist: when frequencies are equal, we sort lexicographically. A heap is perfect for this because we can maintain the top k elements efficiently while respecting both frequency and lexicographical ordering.

### APPROACH:
1. **Count frequencies**: Use HashMap to count word frequencies
2. **Use min-heap**: Maintain heap of size k with custom comparator
3. **Custom comparator**: Less frequent words first, then reverse lexicographical order
4. **Build result**: Extract from heap and reverse to get correct order

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Min-heap keeps smallest elements at root, so we keep the k largest
- Custom comparator: (-frequency, word) ensures frequent words stay in heap
- For equal frequencies, lexicographically smaller words are "larger" in our heap
- Final result needs reversal because heap gives us reverse order

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Frequencies: {"i": 2, "love": 2, "leetcode": 1, "coding": 1}
Heap process:
- Add ("i", 2): heap = [(-2, "i")]
- Add ("love", 2): heap = [(-2, "love"), (-2, "i")] (love > i lexicographically)
- Add ("leetcode", 1): heap = [(-1, "leetcode"), (-2, "i"), (-2, "love")]
- Remove leetcode: heap = [(-2, "love"), (-2, "i")]
- Add ("coding", 1): heap = [(-1, "coding"), (-2, "i"), (-2, "love")]
- Remove coding: heap = [(-2, "love"), (-2, "i")]
Result: ["i", "love"] (after reversing)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(N log k)
Where N is number of words, k is the result size. Heap operations are O(log k).

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(N + k)
O(N) for frequency map, O(k) for heap

### EDGE CASES:
- k equals number of unique words
- All words have same frequency (pure lexicographical sort)
- Single word repeated
- k = 1 with multiple candidates
