I'll help you implement the Meeting Rooms II solution in Python. This solution will determine the minimum number of meeting rooms required to accommodate all meetings.

```python
from typing import List
import heapq

class Solution:
    """
    Solution class for the Meeting Rooms II problem.
    Determines the minimum number of meeting rooms required to hold all meetings.
    """
    
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        """
        Calculate the minimum number of meeting rooms required.
        
        Args:
            intervals: List of meetings where each meeting is [start_time, end_time]
            
        Returns:
            int: Minimum number of meeting rooms needed
            
        Time Complexity: O(nlogn) where n is the number of meetings
        Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the heap
        """
        # Handle edge cases
        if not intervals:
            return 0
        if len(intervals) == 1:
            return 1
            
        # Sort meetings by start time
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        
        # Initialize a min heap to track meeting end times
        rooms = []
        # Add first meeting's end time to heap
        heapq.heappush(rooms, intervals[0][1])
        
        # Process remaining meetings
        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            # If the earliest ending meeting ends before current meeting starts
            # we can reuse that room
            if rooms[0] <= intervals[i][0]:
                heapq.heappop(rooms)
            
            # Add current meeting's end time to heap
            heapq.heappush(rooms, intervals[i][1])
            
        # The size of heap represents minimum rooms needed
        return len(rooms)


def test_solution():
    """
    Test function to verify the solution with different test cases.
    """
    solution = Solution()
    
    # Test case 1: Regular case
    assert solution.minMeetingRooms([[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]) == 2
    
    # Test case 2: Overlapping meetings
    assert solution.minMeetingRooms([[7, 10], [2, 4]]) == 1
    
    # Test case 3: Empty input
    assert solution.minMeetingRooms([]) == 0
    
    # Test case 4: Single meeting
    assert solution.minMeetingRooms([[1, 5]]) == 1
    
    # Test case 5: Multiple overlapping meetings
    assert solution.minMeetingRooms([[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20], [1, 25]]) == 3
    
    print("All test cases passed!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run the test cases
    test_solution()
```

This implementation includes:

1. A `Solution` class with the main `minMeetingRooms` method that solves the problem
2. Comprehensive documentation and comments explaining the approach
3. Efficient algorithm using a min heap to track meeting rooms
4. Test cases covering various scenarios
5. Proper handling of edge cases
6. Time and space complexity analysis

The algorithm works by:
1. Sorting meetings by start time
2. Using a min heap to track end times of ongoing meetings
3. For each meeting, checking if we can reuse an existing room or need a new one
4. The final heap size gives us the minimum number of rooms needed

The solution handles edge cases like empty input and single meetings, and includes test cases to verify correctness.
