# 973. K Closest Points To Origin

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., √(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>points = [[1,3], [-2,2], [5,8], [0,1]], k = 2</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>[[0,1], [-2,2]]</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>The k=2 closest points to origin are [[1,3],[-2,2]]</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>🔍 SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>
### METADATA:
**Techniques**: Hash Table Lookup, Hash Map Storage, Array Traversal
**Data Structures**: Hash Map, Array, Heap
**Patterns**: Two Pointers Pattern, Greedy Algorithm
**Time Complexity**: O(n)
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - Constant extra space

### INTUITION:
Calculate distance for each point. Use max heap (negate distances) of size k. Maintain k closest points. Alternatively, use quickselect for O(n) average time.

### APPROACH:
1. **Calculate distances**: For each point, compute squared distance = x^2 + y^2
2. **Build min heap**: Push (distance, point) tuples to heap
3. **Use heapify**: Or push one by one using heappush
4. **Extract k smallest**: Pop from heap k times
5. **Build result**: For each popped element, add point to result
6. **Return result**: Return list of k closest points

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Max heap of size k: stores (negative distance, point) to get k smallest
- For each point, calculate distance squared (avoid sqrt for efficiency)
- If heap size < k, push; else if distance < heap[0], pop and push
- Negative distance converts min heap to max heap behavior
- O(n log k) time: n points, log k heap operations, O(k) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
Input:
```
points = [[1,3], [-2,2], [5,8], [0,1]], k = 2
```

Step 1: Calculate distances (squared)
[1,3]: dist = 1² + 3² = 10
[-2,2]: dist = (-2)² + 2² = 8
[5,8]: dist = 5² + 8² = 89
[0,1]: dist = 0² + 1² = 1
Step 2: Build min heap
heap = [(1, [0,1]), (8, [-2,2]), (10, [1,3]), (89, [5,8])]
Step 3: Extract k=2 smallest

Steps:
Step 1: Pop (1, [0,1]) → result = [[0,1]]
Step 2: Pop (8, [-2,2]) → result = [[0,1], [-2,2]]

Output:
```
[[0,1], [-2,2]]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
