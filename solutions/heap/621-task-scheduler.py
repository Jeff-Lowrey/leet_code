I'll help you implement a Task Scheduler solution in Python. This implementation will handle task scheduling with cooldown periods between identical tasks.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter
from heapq import heappush, heappop

class TaskScheduler:
    """
    A class to schedule tasks with cooldown periods between identical tasks.
    Uses a priority queue (heap) based approach for efficient scheduling.
    """
    
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        """
        Calculate the minimum number of units needed to execute all tasks with cooldown.
        
        Args:
            tasks: List of tasks represented by uppercase letters
            n: Cooldown period between identical tasks
            
        Returns:
            Minimum number of units required to complete all tasks
        """
        if not tasks:
            return 0
        
        # Count frequency of each task
        task_counts = Counter(tasks)
        
        # Create max heap (using negative counts for max heap behavior)
        heap = []
        for task, count in task_counts.items():
            heappush(heap, (-count, task))
        
        total_time = 0
        cycle = n + 1  # Length of each scheduling cycle
        
        while heap:
            # Store tasks that need to be processed in current cycle
            temp = []
            cycle_count = min(cycle, len(tasks) - total_time)
            
            # Process tasks for current cycle
            for _ in range(cycle):
                if heap:
                    count, task = heappop(heap)
                    if count < -1:  # If task still has remaining occurrences
                        temp.append((count + 1, task))
                        
            # Put back tasks that still need processing
            for item in temp:
                heappush(heap, item)
                
            # Add time for current cycle
            total_time += cycle if heap else cycle_count
            
        return total_time

def main():
    """
    Main function to demonstrate the TaskScheduler usage with example cases.
    """
    scheduler = TaskScheduler()
    
    # Test cases
    test_cases = [
        (["A","A","A","B","B","B"], 2),
        (["A","A","A","B","B","B"], 0),
        (["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], 2),
    ]
    
    # Run test cases
    for tasks, n in test_cases:
        result = scheduler.leastInterval(tasks, n)
        print(f"Tasks: {tasks}")
        print(f"Cooldown: {n}")
        print(f"Minimum intervals needed: {result}")
        print("-" * 50)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation includes:

1. A `TaskScheduler` class with the main scheduling logic
2. Type hints for better code readability and IDE support
3. Comprehensive comments explaining the implementation
4. A priority queue (heap) based approach for efficient task scheduling
5. A main function with test cases to demonstrate usage
6. Proper error handling and edge cases

The algorithm works by:
1. Counting the frequency of each task
2. Using a max heap to always process the most frequent tasks first
3. Processing tasks in cycles, where each cycle is of length n+1
4. Keeping track of remaining task counts and updating them accordingly

The solution handles various edge cases:
- Empty task list
- Zero cooldown period
- Tasks with different frequencies
- Cases where idle time is needed
- Cases where no idle time is needed

The time complexity is O(N * log(26)) where N is the total number of tasks, and space complexity is O(1) since we store at most 26 different tasks (uppercase letters).
