I'll help you create a solution for the Reorganize String problem that meets all the requirements. Here's the implementation:

Reorganize String - Python Implementation

This module provides a solution to reorganize a string such that no two adjacent
characters are the same. If such reorganization is not possible, returns an empty string.

Example:
    Input: "aab"
    Output: "aba"

    Input: "aaab"
    Output: ""

This implementation:

1. Uses a class-based structure with a clear method signature
2. Includes necessary imports (collections.Counter and heapq)
3. Provides detailed documentation and comments
4. Handles edge cases (empty string, impossible reorganization)
5. Includes a comprehensive test function
6. Follows Python conventions and best practices

The algorithm:
1. Counts character frequencies using Counter
2. Checks if reorganization is possible by verifying max frequency
3. Uses a max heap to always get the two most frequent remaining characters
4. Builds the result string by alternating characters
5. Handles the last character separately

The solution is efficient with O(n log k) time complexity where n is the string length and k is the number of unique characters.

The test function verifies the solution with various test cases and prints the results.
