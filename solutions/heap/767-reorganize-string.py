# 767. Reorganize String

Given a problem that demonstrates key concepts in Heap.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[input description]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>[output description]</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>[explanation]</dd>

### INTUITION:
[This problem requires understanding of heap concepts. The key insight is to identify the optimal approach for this specific scenario.]

### APPROACH:
1. **Analyze the problem**: Understand the input constraints and expected output
2. **Choose the right technique**: Apply heap methodology
3. **Implement efficiently**: Focus on optimal time and space complexity
4. **Handle edge cases**: Consider boundary conditions and special cases

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- The solution leverages heap principles
- Time complexity is optimized for the given constraints
- Space complexity is minimized where possible

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: [example input]
Step 1: [explain first step]
Step 2: [explain second step]
Output: [expected output]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
