# 767. Reorganize String

Given a string s, rearrange the characters of s so that any two adjacent characters are not the same.

Return any possible rearrangement of s or return "" if not possible.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>"aab"</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"aba" (reorganized string)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Reorganized string 'aab' becomes 'aba' (no two adjacent same)</dd>
</dl>

### INTUITION:
Use max heap to track character frequencies. Greedily pick most frequent character, add to result, decrease count, and temporarily hold it. Add back to heap after one position to ensure no adjacent duplicates.

### APPROACH:
1. **Count frequencies**: Use Counter(s) to get character frequencies
2. **Check feasibility**: If max_freq > (len(s) + 1) // 2, return empty string
3. **Build max heap**: Push (-freq, char) to heap for all characters
4. **Initialize result**: Set result = [], prev_char = None, prev_freq = 0
5. **Build string**: While heap not empty, pop (freq, char)
6. **Add to result**: Append char to result
7. **Push previous back**: If prev_freq < 0, push (prev_freq, prev_char) to heap
8. **Update previous**: Set prev_char = char, prev_freq = freq + 1, return ''.join(result)

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Max heap by frequency: greedily place most frequent chars first
- Always pick most frequent available char (not same as previous)
- After placing char, decrement count and put back if count > 0
- If can't place without adjacent duplicates, impossible (return "")
- O(n log k) time: k unique chars, n total chars, O(k) space for heap

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: s = "aab"
Step 1: Count character frequencies
  freq = {'a': 2, 'b': 1}

Step 2: Build max heap (using negative frequencies)
  heap = [(-2, 'a'), (-1, 'b')]

Step 3: Rearrange characters
  Pick 'a': result = "a", heap = [(-1, 'b'), (-1, 'a')]
  Pick 'b': result = "ab", heap = [(-1, 'a')]
  Pick 'a': result = "aba"

Output: "aba" (reorganized string)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
