/**
 * 289. Game Of Life
 * Medium
 *
 * This problem demonstrates key concepts in Simulation.
 *
 * SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
 *
 * INTUITION:
 * The challenge is applying rules simultaneously to all cells. Use state encoding to track both current and next states in-place, avoiding extra space while ensuring all decisions are based on the original state.
 *
 * APPROACH:
 * 1. **State Encoding**: Use 4 states instead of 2
   - 0: dead → dead
   - 1: live → live
   - 2: live → dead (dying)
   - 3: dead → live (born)
2. **Two Passes**: First pass marks transitions, second pass finalizes states
3. **Neighbor Counting**: Count neighbors considering only original states (0,1 and 2 were originally live)
 *
 * WHY THIS WORKS:
 * The encoding preserves original state information while tracking transitions. During neighbor counting, we can distinguish original live cells (1 or 2) from original dead cells (0 or 3), ensuring correct rule application.
 *
 * TIME COMPLEXITY: O(m × n)
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)
 *
 * EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
Initial: [0,1,0]    →    [0,0,0]
         [0,0,1]    →    [1,0,1]
         [1,1,1]    →    [0,1,1]
         [0,0,0]    →    [0,1,0]
```

Live cell (1,2) has 3 neighbors → survives
Dead cell (1,0) has 3 neighbors → becomes alive
Dead cell (0,1) has 2 neighbors → stays dead
 *
 * EDGE CASES:
 * [EDGE CASES content will be added here]
