# 715. Range Module

A Range Module is a module that tracks ranges of numbers. Design a data structure to track the ranges represented as half-open intervals and query about them.

A half-open interval [left, right) denotes all the real numbers x where left <= x < right.

Implement the RangeModule class:

- RangeModule() Initializes the object.
- void addRange(int left, int right) Adds the half-open interval [left, right), tracking every real number in that interval.
- boolean queryRange(int left, int right) Returns true if every real number in the interval [left, right) is currently being tracked, and false otherwise.
- void removeRange(int left, int right) Stops tracking every real number currently being tracked in the half-open interval [left, right).

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>addRange(10, 20): ranges = [(10, 20)]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>removeRange(14, 16): ranges = [(10, 14), (16, 20)]</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>After addRange(10,20) and queryRange(10,14), it returns true</dd>
</dl>

### INTUITION:
This problem requires efficient range updates and queries. We can use segment trees with lazy propagation, or maintain a sorted list of disjoint intervals and merge/split them as needed.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize interval list**: Create empty sorted list to store disjoint intervals [left, right)
2. **addRange operation**: Find all intervals that overlap or are adjacent to [left, right), merge them into single interval
3. **Remove overlapping**: Delete all intervals that would be merged, insert new merged interval maintaining sorted order
4. **queryRange operation**: Binary search to find intervals that could contain [left, right), verify complete coverage
5. **removeRange operation**: Find all intervals that overlap with [left, right), split them and remove the overlapping parts
6. **Maintain invariants**: Keep intervals sorted and disjoint at all times for efficient operations
7. **Return query result**: For queries, return True only if entire range is continuously tracked

### WHY THIS WORKS:
The algorithm correctly solves the problem by systematically exploring all valid states while maintaining necessary invariants. Each step preserves correctness through careful state management, and the base cases handle edge conditions properly. The approach guarantees finding the solution (if one exists) by examining all possibilities or efficiently pruning invalid paths.

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
addRange(10, 20): ranges = [(10, 20)]
removeRange(14, 16): ranges = [(10, 14), (16, 20)]
queryRange(10, 14): true (fully covered)
queryRange(13, 15): false (15 not covered)
queryRange(16, 17): true (fully covered)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
- Segment Tree: O(log n) per operation
- Sorted Intervals: O(n) worst case, O(log n) average

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(n)
For tree or interval list

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty ranges
- Overlapping add operations
- Removing non-existent ranges
- Query on empty module
- Adjacent intervals (should merge)
