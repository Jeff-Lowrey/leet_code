547. Number of Provinces
Medium

There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is
connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c,
then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other
cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith
city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

Example:
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
This is a classic connected components problem. We need to find groups of cities that are directly or indirectly connected. Each connected component represents one province.

### APPROACH:
1. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set)**: Perfect for tracking connected components
2. **Initialize**: Each city starts as its own province
3. **Union Operations**: For each connection, union the two cities
4. **Count Components**: Count the number of distinct root parents

### WHY THIS WORKS:
Union-Find efficiently maintains connected components. When we union two cities, we're merging their provinces. The number of unique root parents at the end equals the number of provinces.

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n¬≤ √ó Œ±(n))
- n¬≤ to iterate through the matrix
- Œ±(n) is the inverse Ackermann function (practically constant)
- With path compression and union by rank: nearly O(n¬≤)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n)
- Union-Find parent and rank arrays

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
For isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]:
```
Cities: 0, 1, 2
Connections: 0-1 (cities 0 and 1 connected)
Initial: parent = [0, 1, 2], components = 3
Union(0,1): parent = [0, 0, 2], components = 2
Final: 2 provinces (cities {0,1} and {2})
```

### ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
1. **DFS**: Visit all connected cities starting from each unvisited city
2. **BFS**: Similar to DFS but using queue instead of recursion
3. **Union-Find**: Most efficient for this specific problem type

### EDGE CASES:
- Single city: return 1
- No connections: each city is its own province
- All connected: return 1
- Self-connections (diagonal): already handled in matrix

### UNION-FIND OPTIMIZATIONS:
- **Path Compression**: Make nodes point directly to root
- **Union by Rank**: Attach smaller tree under root of larger tree
- Together these make operations nearly O(1) amortized
