# 547. Number of Provinces

There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[[1, 1, 0]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>1</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Number of friend circles is 2</dd>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
This is a classic connected components problem. We need to find how many separate groups of cities exist. Cities in the same group are either directly or indirectly connected. Union-Find is perfect for this as it efficiently manages and counts connected components.

### APPROACH:
1. **Union-Find Structure**: Create a union-find data structure for n cities
2. **Process Connections**: For each connection in the matrix, union the two cities
3. **Count Components**: Count the number of unique root parents (components)
4. **Alternative DFS**: Can also use DFS to mark visited cities in each component

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Union-Find automatically groups connected cities into components
- Each connected component represents one province
- After processing all connections, count unique roots to get province count
- DFS alternative marks all cities in a component as visited

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
isConnected = [[1,1,0],
               [1,1,0],
               [0,0,1]]

Cities: 0, 1, 2
Connections: 0-1 (direct), 2 (isolated)

Union-Find process:
1. Initialize: parent = [0,1,2], each city is its own component
2. Process (0,1): union(0,1) ‚Üí parent = [1,1,2]
3. Process (1,0): already connected, skip
4. Process (2,2): self-connection, skip

Count unique roots: 1 (for cities 0,1) and 2 (for city 2)
Result: 2 provinces
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n¬≤ √ó Œ±(n))
Where Œ± is the inverse Ackermann function (nearly constant)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(n)
For the Union-Find parent and rank arrays

### EDGE CASES:
- **Single city**: Return 1 (one province)
- **All cities connected**: Return 1 (all form single province)
- **All cities isolated**: Return n (each city is its own province)
- **Empty matrix**: Return 0 (no cities)
- **Two separate groups**: Union-find counts distinct components correctly
