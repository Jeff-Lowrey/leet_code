# 323. Number Of Connected Components In An Undirected Graph

You have a graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an integer n and a list of edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return the number of connected components in the graph.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,4]]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>See walkthrough</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Number of connected components in undirected graph is 2</dd>
</dl>

### INTUITION:
This is a classic Union-Find problem for counting connected components. Each connected component is a set of nodes that can reach each other through edges. Union-Find efficiently groups nodes into components and counts distinct groups.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize Union-Find**: Each node starts as its own component
2. **Process edges**: Union connected nodes, reducing component count
3. **Count components**: Count number of distinct parent nodes

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Union-Find maintains disjoint sets (connected components)
- Each union operation merges two components into one
- Final count of root nodes = number of connected components
- Path compression and union by rank ensure efficient operations

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,4]]

Initial: {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4} ‚Üí 5 components
Union(0,1): {0,1}, {2}, {3}, {4} ‚Üí 4 components
Union(1,2): {0,1,2}, {3}, {4} ‚Üí 3 components
Union(3,4): {0,1,2}, {3,4} ‚Üí 2 components

Result: 2 connected components
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(E √ó Œ±(N))
Where E is edges, N is nodes, Œ± is inverse Ackermann (nearly constant)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(N)
For parent and rank arrays

### EDGE CASES:
- No edges: n isolated components
- Fully connected: 1 component
- Self-loops: don't change component count
- Single node: 1 component
