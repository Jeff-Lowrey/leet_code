# Difficulty: Medium

# 305. Number

You are given an empty 2D binary grid grid of size m x n. The grid represents a map where 0's represent water and 1's represent land. Initially, all the cells of grid are water cells (i.e., all the cells are 0's).

We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. You are given an array positions where positions[i] = [ri, ci] is the position (ri, ci) at which we should operate the ith operation.

Return an array of integers answer where answer[i] is the number of islands after turning the cell (ri, ci) into a land.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[[0, 0]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"Test 1 Result: {result1}"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Number of islands after adding positions: [1,1,2,3]</dd>
</dl>

### INTUITION:
Maintain Union-Find of islands. For each land operation, union with adjacent land cells (4 directions). Track number of connected components. Component count after each operation is island count.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize Union-Find**: Create parent and rank arrays
2. **Initialize count**: Set count = 0 for number of islands
3. **Process positions**: For each position in positions list
4. **Add island**: Mark position as land, increment count
5. **Check neighbors**: Check all 4 adjacent cells
6. **Union with land neighbors**: If neighbor is land and different component, union and decrement count
7. **Record count**: Append current count to result
8. **Return result**: Return result list with island counts

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Union-find tracks connected components as islands form
- Initially count = 0, increment for each land cell added
- When land connects to existing islands, union them (decrement count by merges-1)
- Path compression + union by rank ensures near O(1) amortized operations
- O(m*n*Œ±(m*n)) time: Œ± is inverse Ackermann (effectively constant)

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, positions = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,1]]
Step 1: Add islands one by one
  [0,0]: 1 island
  [0,1]: merge with [0,0] ‚Üí 1 island
  [1,2]: 2 islands
  [2,1]: 3 islands

Output: [1,1,2,3]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
