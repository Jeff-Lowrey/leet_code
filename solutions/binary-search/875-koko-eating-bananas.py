# 875. Koko Eating Bananas

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>4 (minimum eating speed)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Minimum eating speed k=4 allows finishing all banana piles within h hours</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Binary search on the eating speed k, not the array. The minimum k is 1, maximum is max(piles). For each mid speed, calculate total hours needed. If hours <= h, try smaller k; otherwise try larger k. Find the minimum valid k.

### APPROACH:
1. **Define search range**: Set left = 1 (minimum speed), right = max(piles) (maximum speed)
2. **Binary search on speed**: While left < right, calculate mid = (left + right) // 2
3. **Calculate hours needed**: For speed mid, compute hours = sum(ceil(pile / mid) for pile in piles)
4. **Check feasibility**: Compare hours with h to determine if speed mid works
5. **Speed too slow**: If hours > h, increase speed: left = mid + 1
6. **Speed works**: If hours <= h, try slower speed: right = mid
7. **Find minimum speed**: Continue until left == right
8. **Return result**: Return left as the minimum eating speed

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Binary search on eating speed: min=1, max=max(piles)
- For each speed k, calculate hours needed: ceil(pile / k) for each pile
- If total hours <= h, try smaller speed (right = mid - 1)
- If total hours > h, need faster speed (left = mid + 1)
- O(n log m) time: log m binary search, O(n) to verify, O(1) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Step 1: Initialize search space
  left = 1 (min speed), right = 11 (max pile size)

Step 2: Binary search for minimum speed
  mid = 6: hours = ceil(3/6)+ceil(6/6)+ceil(7/6)+ceil(11/6) = 1+1+2+2 = 6 ‚â§ 8
  ‚Üí Try lower speed, right = 6

  mid = 3: hours = ceil(3/3)+ceil(6/3)+ceil(7/3)+ceil(11/3) = 1+2+3+4 = 10 > 8
  ‚Üí Need higher speed, left = 4

  mid = 5: hours = ceil(3/5)+ceil(6/5)+ceil(7/5)+ceil(11/5) = 1+2+2+3 = 8 ‚â§ 8
  ‚Üí Try lower speed, right = 5

  mid = 4: hours = ceil(3/4)+ceil(6/4)+ceil(7/4)+ceil(11/4) = 1+2+2+3 = 8 ‚â§ 8
  ‚Üí Try lower speed, right = 4

  left = right = 4

Output: 4 (minimum eating speed)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
