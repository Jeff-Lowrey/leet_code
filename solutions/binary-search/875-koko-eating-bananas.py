I'll help you implement the Koko Eating Bananas solution in Python. This will solve the problem of finding the minimum eating speed that allows Koko to eat all bananas within a given time limit.

Koko Eating Bananas - Solution

Problem: Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has
piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours. Koko can decide
her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas
and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all
of them and won't eat any more bananas during this hour.

Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

This implementation includes:

1. A complete solution using binary search to find the minimum eating speed
2. Proper type hints and documentation
3. Helper method to calculate hours needed for a given speed
4. Main function with test cases
5. Clean code structure following Python conventions
6. Efficient implementation using binary search
7. Proper handling of edge cases
8. Clear comments explaining the logic

The solution uses binary search to efficiently find the minimum eating speed that allows Koko to eat all bananas within the given time limit. The search space is between 1 (minimum possible speed) and the maximum pile size (maximum needed speed).

The code is structured as a complete, runnable file with example test cases in the main function. It follows Python best practices and includes proper documentation and type hints.
