I'll help you implement the Koko Eating solution in JavaScript. This will solve the problem of finding the minimum eating speed for Koko to eat all bananas within the given hours.

```javascript
/**
 * Koko Eating Bananas Implementation
 * Problem: Find minimum eating speed K such that Koko can eat all bananas within H hours
 * 
 * @param {number[]} piles - Array of banana piles where piles[i] represents bananas in ith pile
 * @param {number} h - Hours available to eat all bananas
 * @return {number} - Minimum eating speed required
 */

/**
 * Calculate total hours needed to eat all bananas at given speed
 * @param {number[]} piles - Array of banana piles
 * @param {number} speed - Eating speed to test
 * @return {number} - Total hours needed
 */
function calculateHours(piles, speed) {
    let totalHours = 0;
    for (let pile of piles) {
        // Math.ceil because Koko must finish each pile before moving to next
        totalHours += Math.ceil(pile / speed);
    }
    return totalHours;
}

/**
 * Find minimum eating speed required
 * @param {number[]} piles - Array of banana piles
 * @param {number} h - Hours available
 * @return {number} - Minimum eating speed
 */
function minEatingSpeed(piles, h) {
    // Edge case: invalid input
    if (!piles || piles.length === 0 || h < piles.length) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Binary search boundaries
    let left = 1; // Minimum possible speed
    let right = Math.max(...piles); // Maximum possible speed

    // Binary search for minimum valid speed
    while (left < right) {
        const mid = Math.floor(left + (right - left) / 2);
        const hoursNeeded = calculateHours(piles, mid);

        if (hoursNeeded <= h) {
            // Speed might be too high, try lower
            right = mid;
        } else {
            // Speed is too low, need higher
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return left;
}

// Export for testing/usage
module.exports = {
    minEatingSpeed,
    calculateHours
};

// Example usage and test cases
function runTests() {
    const testCases = [
        {
            piles: [3, 6, 7, 11],
            h: 8,
            expected: 4
        },
        {
            piles: [30, 11, 23, 4, 20],
            h: 5,
            expected: 30
        },
        {
            piles: [30, 11, 23, 4, 20],
            h: 6,
            expected: 23
        }
    ];

    for (let i = 0; i < testCases.length; i++) {
        const { piles, h, expected } = testCases[i];
        const result = minEatingSpeed(piles, h);
        console.log(`Test case ${i + 1}:`);
        console.log(`Input: piles = [${piles}], h = ${h}`);
        console.log(`Expected: ${expected}`);
        console.log(`Result: ${result}`);
        console.log(`Status: ${result === expected ? 'PASSED' : 'FAILED'}`);
        console.log('---');
    }
}

// Uncomment to run tests
// runTests();
```

This implementation includes:

1. A binary search approach to find the minimum eating speed
2. Helper function to calculate hours needed for a given speed
3. Proper error handling for edge cases
4. Clear documentation and comments
5. Test cases with example usage
6. Module exports for integration into larger projects

The solution uses binary search to efficiently find the minimum eating speed K where:
- The search space is from 1 to max(piles)
- For each middle point, we calculate if Koko can eat all bananas within H hours
- We narrow down the search space based on whether the current speed is sufficient

The time complexity is O(n * log m) where:
- n is the length of piles array
- m is the maximum number in piles

The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

The code includes test cases but they're commented out by default. You can uncomment the `runTests()` call to execute them.
