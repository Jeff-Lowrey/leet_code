I'll help you create a solution for the Find Peak problem that meets all the requirements. Here's the complete implementation:

Find Peak Element Implementation (LeetCode 162)

This module implements a solution to find a peak element in an array.
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

For an array nums, nums[i] is a peak element if:
- For i = 0: nums[0] > nums[1]
- For i = n-1: nums[n-1] > nums[n-2]
- For others: nums[i] > nums[i-1] and nums[i] > nums[i+1]

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

```

This implementation includes:

1. A complete solution using binary search to find a peak element
2. Proper documentation with docstrings and comments
3. Type hints using the typing module
4. A test function to verify the implementation
5. Example usage in the main block
6. Edge case handling
7. Clean code structure following Python conventions

The solution uses binary search to achieve O(log n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. It handles all edge cases and includes comprehensive test cases to verify the implementation works correctly.

The code can be saved directly to `generated/BS-162-PY_find_peak___python_implementation.py` and will be ready to run. It includes both the solution class and a testing framework to verify the implementation.
