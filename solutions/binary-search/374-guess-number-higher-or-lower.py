I'll help you create a clean implementation of the Guess Number problem in Python. Here's the complete solution:

```python
# Guess Number - Python Implementation
# Time Complexity: O(log n) - Binary Search approach
# Space Complexity: O(1) - Only using constant extra space

def guess(num: int) -> int:
    """
    This is a pre-defined API function that would be provided in the actual problem.
    For testing purposes, we can implement it with a picked number.
    Returns:
        -1 if num is higher than the picked number
        1 if num is lower than the picked number
        0 if num equals the picked number
    """
    picked = 6  # Example picked number for testing
    if num > picked:
        return -1
    elif num < picked:
        return 1
    return 0

def guessNumber(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Binary search implementation to find the picked number.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper bound of the range (1 to n)
    
    Returns:
        int: The picked number
    
    Example:
        Input: n = 10
        Output: 6 (assuming 6 is the picked number)
    """
    left = 1
    right = n
    
    while left <= right:
        # Calculate mid point
        # Using (left + right) // 2 might cause integer overflow
        # Hence using this alternative formula
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        
        # Make a guess
        result = guess(mid)
        
        # If guess is correct, return the number
        if result == 0:
            return mid
        # If guess is too high, search in lower half
        elif result == -1:
            right = mid - 1
        # If guess is too low, search in upper half
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    return left  # This line should never be reached given problem constraints

def main():
    """
    Main function to test the implementation
    """
    # Test cases
    test_cases = [10, 1, 2, 100]
    
    for n in test_cases:
        result = guessNumber(n)
        print(f"For n = {n}, picked number is: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation includes:

1. A clean and efficient binary search solution with O(log n) time complexity
2. Proper documentation and comments explaining the implementation
3. A mock `guess()` API function for testing purposes
4. A main function with test cases
5. Proper handling of potential integer overflow in binary search
6. Clear variable names and Python conventions

The code follows the standard binary search pattern but is specifically adapted for the guess number game where:
- If the guess is too high, we search in the lower half
- If the guess is too low, we search in the upper half
- If the guess is correct, we return the number

The implementation is complete and can be run as a standalone Python file. It includes error handling and follows Python best practices.

Note: The actual `guess()` function would be provided by the system in a real problem setting. The one implemented here is just for testing purposes.
