# 374. Guess Number Higher Or Lower
# Difficulty: Easy
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
- -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
- 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
- 0: Your guess is correct (i.e. num == pick).

Return the number that I picked.

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
This is a classic binary search problem where we need to find a target number using feedback from a guess API. The key insight is to use the API response to narrow down the search space by half in each iteration.

### APPROACH:
1. **Binary search**: Use binary search on the range [1, n]
2. **API feedback**: Use guess() API response to adjust search bounds
3. **Boundary adjustment**: Move left/right pointers based on feedback
4. **Termination**: Continue until API returns 0 (correct guess)

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Binary search optimally reduces search space by half each iteration
- API feedback provides perfect direction information
- Guaranteed to find the answer in O(log n) time
- Similar to searching in a sorted array but using API instead of direct comparison

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(log n)
Binary search through range [1, n]

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)
Only using constant extra space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Step 1: guess(5) returns 1 (pick > 5), so left = 6
Step 2: guess(8) returns -1 (pick < 8), so right = 7
Step 3: guess(6) returns 0 (correct!)
Output: 6

Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Step 1: guess(1) returns 0 (correct!)
Output: 1

Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Step 1: guess(1) returns 0 (correct!)
Output: 1
```

### KEY INSIGHTS:
- Standard binary search template applies directly
- API response guides the search direction
- No need for array or list - just search the number space
- Handle integer overflow in mid calculation

### EDGE CASES:
- Single number (n = 1): return 1
- Pick at boundaries (pick = 1 or pick = n)
- Large n values: use overflow-safe mid calculation
