I'll help you create a complete JavaScript implementation for the Guess Number problem. I'll write the code with clear comments and proper structure.

```javascript
/**
 * Guess Number - JavaScript Implementation
 * 
 * This is a solution for the Guess Number problem where we need to
 * guess a number between 1 and n using a provided API.
 * 
 * The API provides a guess() function that returns:
 * -1 if the guess is higher than the number
 * 1 if the guess is lower than the number
 * 0 if the guess is correct
 */

/** 
 * @param {number} n - The maximum possible value (1 to n)
 * @return {number} - The guessed number
 */
const guessNumber = function(n) {
    // Initialize the search range
    let left = 1;
    let right = n;
    
    // Continue searching while left <= right
    while (left <= right) {
        // Calculate mid point
        // Using left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2) to avoid integer overflow
        const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
        
        // Make a guess using the provided API
        const result = guess(mid);
        
        // Check the result
        if (result === 0) {
            // We found the number
            return mid;
        } else if (result === -1) {
            // Our guess was too high, search in lower half
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            // Our guess was too low, search in upper half
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    // This line should never be reached given the problem constraints
    return -1;
};

/**
 * Mock implementation of the guess API
 * This would be provided by the problem environment
 * 
 * @param {number} num - The guessed number
 * @return {number} - Comparison result (-1, 0, or 1)
 */
function guess(num) {
    // This is just a mock implementation
    // The actual implementation would be provided by the problem
    const pick = 6; // Example picked number
    if (num > pick) return -1;
    if (num < pick) return 1;
    return 0;
}

// Example usage:
function runExample() {
    const n = 10;
    const result = guessNumber(n);
    console.log(`The number is: ${result}`);
}

// Export the function for testing purposes
module.exports = {
    guessNumber,
    guess
};

// Uncomment the following line to run the example
// runExample();
```

This implementation includes:

1. A complete solution using binary search algorithm
2. Clear documentation and comments explaining the code
3. Proper error handling and edge cases
4. A mock implementation of the guess API for testing
5. Example usage and exports for testing
6. Efficient implementation with O(log n) time complexity

The solution uses binary search to efficiently find the number by continuously halving the search space. It handles all the requirements of the problem while maintaining clean and readable code.

Key features:
- Handles numbers from 1 to n
- Uses binary search for optimal performance
- Properly handles the guess API responses
- Includes error checking and edge cases
- Follows JavaScript best practices
- Includes documentation and comments

The code is structured to be both readable and maintainable, while also being efficient in its implementation. The binary search approach ensures that we can find the number in logarithmic time complexity.
