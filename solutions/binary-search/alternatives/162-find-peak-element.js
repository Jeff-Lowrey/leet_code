 * Find Peak Element - JavaScript Implementation LeetCode 162: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/ Problem: Given an array of integers nums, find a peak element in the array. A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors. Note: - Array elements are 0-indexed - Edge elements only need to be greater than their single neighbor - It's guaranteed that the answer exists (at least one peak) - Multiple peaks may exist; returning any valid peak index is acceptable

 * <summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>
 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * The key insight for solving Find Peak Element is to understand the core problem pattern
 * and apply the most efficient algorithmic approach.
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. Analyze the problem requirements
 * 2. Choose the optimal data structure
 * 3. Implement the solution step by step
 * 4. Handle edge cases appropriately
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * This approach works because it leverages the fundamental properties of the problem
 * to achieve an efficient solution.
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * For a typical input, the algorithm processes the data systematically
 * to produce the expected output.
