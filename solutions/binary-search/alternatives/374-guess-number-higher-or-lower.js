 * # 374. Guess Number Higher Or Lower
 *
 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 *
 * I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
 *
 * Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
 *
 * You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
 * - -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
 * - 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
 * - 0: Your guess is correct (i.e. num == pick).
 *
 * Return the number that I picked.
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>[(10, 6), (100, 25), (50, 1), (1, 1)]</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>"Range [1, {n}], picked number: {result}"</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>Target number is guessed using binary search strategy</dd>
 * </dl>

 * <summary><b>🔍 SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>
 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * This is a classic binary search problem where we need to find a target number using feedback from a guess API. The key insight is to use the API response to narrow down the search space by half in each iteration.
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Binary search**: Use binary search on the range [1, n]
 * 2. **API feedback**: Use guess() API response to adjust search bounds
 * 3. **Boundary adjustment**: Move left/right pointers based on feedback
 * 4. **Termination**: Continue until API returns 0 (correct guess)
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * - Binary search optimally reduces search space by half each iteration
 * - API feedback provides perfect direction information
 * - Guaranteed to find the answer in O(log n) time
 * - Similar to searching in a sorted array but using API instead of direct comparison
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
 * Input: n = 10, pick = 6
 * Step 1: guess(5) returns 1 (pick > 5), so left = 6
 * Step 2: guess(8) returns -1 (pick < 8), so right = 7
 * Step 3: guess(6) returns 0 (correct!)
 * Output: 6
 *
 * Input: n = 1, pick = 1
 * Step 1: guess(1) returns 0 (correct!)
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Input: n = 2, pick = 1
 * Step 1: guess(1) returns 0 (correct!)
 * Output: 1
 * ```
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(log n)
 * Binary search through range [1, n]
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(1)
 * Only using constant extra space
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - Single number (n = 1): return 1
 * - Pick at boundaries (pick = 1 or pick = n)
 * - Large n values: use overflow-safe mid calculation
