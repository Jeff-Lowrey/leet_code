/**
 * Example usage:
 * 
 * const isBadVersion = version => version >= 4;
 * const firstBadVersion = solution(isBadVersion);
 * console.log(firstBadVersion(5)); // Output: 4
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * - The function uses binary search to efficiently find the first bad version
 * - It maintains two pointers: left and right
 * - In each iteration, it checks the middle version
 * - If middle version is bad, search in left half
 * - If middle version is good, search in right half
 * - Process continues until left and right pointers converge
 * 
 * Note:
 * - The solution assumes that isBadVersion API is already defined
 * - The implementation handles potential integer overflow using unsigned right shift
 * - The solution is optimized for large numbers of versions
