<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
[This problem requires understanding of binary search concepts. The key insight is to identify the optimal approach for this specific scenario.]

### APPROACH:
1. **Analyze the problem**: Understand the input constraints and expected output
2. **Choose the right technique**: Apply binary search methodology

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: [example input]
Step 1: [explain first step]
Step 2: [explain second step]
Output: [expected output]
```

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
