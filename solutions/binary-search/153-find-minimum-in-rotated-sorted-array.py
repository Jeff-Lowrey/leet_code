I'll help you create a solution for finding the minimum element in a rotated sorted array. Here's the implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    """
    Solution class for finding the minimum element in a rotated sorted array.
    
    The array is originally sorted in ascending order but has been rotated 
    between 1 and n times.
    """
    
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Finds the minimum element in a rotated sorted array using binary search.
        
        Args:
            nums: List[int] - Input array that was originally sorted then rotated
            
        Returns:
            int - The minimum element in the array
            
        Time Complexity: O(log n)
        Space Complexity: O(1)
        """
        # Handle edge cases
        if not nums:
            return 0
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]
        
        # If array is not rotated (already sorted)
        if nums[0] < nums[-1]:
            return nums[0]
        
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        
        # Binary search implementation
        while left <= right:
            # If we're down to two elements, return the minimum
            if right - left <= 1:
                return min(nums[left], nums[right])
            
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            
            # If mid element is greater than right element,
            # minimum must be in right half
            if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
                left = mid
            # If mid element is less than right element,
            # minimum must be in left half (including mid)
            else:
                right = mid
                
        return nums[left]


def test_find_minimum():
    """
    Test function to verify the solution with various test cases.
    """
    solution = Solution()
    
    # Test cases
    test_cases = [
        ([3, 4, 5, 1, 2], 1),
        ([4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], 0),
        ([11, 13, 15, 17], 11),
        ([2, 1], 1),
        ([1], 1),
        ([3, 1, 2], 1)
    ]
    
    # Run tests
    for i, (input_array, expected) in enumerate(test_cases):
        result = solution.findMin(input_array)
        assert result == expected, f"Test case {i + 1} failed: expected {expected}, got {result}"
        print(f"Test case {i + 1} passed: Input {input_array}, Output {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run the test cases
    test_find_minimum()
```

This implementation provides a solution to find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array using binary search. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. The `Solution` class contains the main `findMin` method that implements the binary search algorithm.

2. The algorithm works by:
   - Handling edge cases (empty array, single element, already sorted array)
   - Using binary search to find the pivot point where the rotation occurred
   - The minimum element will be at this pivot point

3. Time complexity is O(log n) as it uses binary search.

4. Space complexity is O(1) as it uses constant extra space.

5. The implementation includes:
   - Type hints for better code readability
   - Comprehensive comments explaining the logic
   - Edge case handling
   - A test function with various test cases

6. The test cases cover different scenarios:
   - Regular rotated arrays
   - Already sorted arrays
   - Arrays with two elements
   - Arrays with single element
   - Arrays with different rotation points

The code follows Python best practices and conventions, including proper naming, documentation, and structure. It can be run directly to execute the test cases and verify the implementation works correctly.
