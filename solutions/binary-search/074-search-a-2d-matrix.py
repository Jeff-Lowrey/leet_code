I'll help you create a solution for the Search 2D Matrix problem. I'll write a clean, well-documented implementation that follows Python best practices.

Search 2D Matrix - LeetCode 74

This module implements a solution for searching a target value in a 2D matrix
where each row is sorted in ascending order and the first element of each row
is greater than the last element of the previous row.

Time Complexity: O(log(m*n)) where m is number of rows and n is number of columns
Space Complexity: O(1)

This implementation includes:

1. A clear module docstring explaining the problem and complexity
2. Type hints using the typing module
3. A Solution class with the main searchMatrix method
4. Detailed comments explaining the logic
5. A comprehensive test function with various test cases
6. Proper error handling for edge cases
7. Clean code structure following PEP 8 guidelines

The solution uses binary search to treat the 2D matrix as a sorted 1D array, which provides optimal O(log(m*n)) time complexity. The implementation handles various edge cases including:
- Empty matrix
- Single row matrix
- Single column matrix
- Normal cases with multiple rows and columns

The test function verifies the implementation with different scenarios to ensure correctness.

To use this code, you can either:
1. Run it directly to execute the test cases
2. Import the Solution class and use it in your own code
3. Use it as part of a larger system where you need to search in a 2D matrix
