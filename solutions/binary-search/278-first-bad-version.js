I'll help you create a solution for the First Bad Version problem in JavaScript. I'll write a complete implementation with comments and proper structure.

```javascript
/**
 * First Bad Version - Solution
 * 
 * The problem is to find the first bad version in a sequence of versions,
 * given that all versions after a bad version are also bad.
 * 
 * Approach: Binary Search
 * Time Complexity: O(log n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 */

/**
 * Definition for isBadVersion()
 * 
 * @param {integer} version number
 * @return {boolean} whether the version is bad
 * isBadVersion = function(version) {
 *     @return {boolean};
 * };
 */

/**
 * @param {function} isBadVersion()
 * @return {function}
 */
const solution = function(isBadVersion) {
    /**
     * @param {integer} n Total versions
     * @return {integer} The first bad version
     */
    return function(n) {
        // Edge case: if there's only one version
        if (n === 1) return 1;
        
        let left = 1;
        let right = n;
        
        // Binary search implementation
        while (left < right) {
            // Calculate mid point using unsigned right shift to avoid overflow
            const mid = left + ((right - left) >>> 1);
            
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                // If current version is bad, look in left half
                right = mid;
            } else {
                // If current version is good, look in right half
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        // At this point, left and right have converged to the first bad version
        return left;
    };
};

// Export the solution for testing purposes
module.exports = solution;

/**
 * Example usage:
 * 
 * const isBadVersion = version => version >= 4;
 * const firstBadVersion = solution(isBadVersion);
 * console.log(firstBadVersion(5)); // Output: 4
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * - The function uses binary search to efficiently find the first bad version
 * - It maintains two pointers: left and right
 * - In each iteration, it checks the middle version
 * - If middle version is bad, search in left half
 * - If middle version is good, search in right half
 * - Process continues until left and right pointers converge
 * 
 * Note:
 * - The solution assumes that isBadVersion API is already defined
 * - The implementation handles potential integer overflow using unsigned right shift
 * - The solution is optimized for large numbers of versions
 */
```

This implementation provides a complete solution to the First Bad Version problem with the following features:

1. Clean and efficient binary search implementation
2. Proper error handling and edge cases
3. Detailed comments explaining the approach and implementation
4. Follows JavaScript best practices and conventions
5. Includes example usage and explanation
6. Handles potential integer overflow
7. Exports the solution for testing purposes

The solution uses binary search to achieve O(log n) time complexity, which is optimal for this problem. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of extra space.

The code is structured to be easily readable and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns and proper documentation. It can be directly used in a JavaScript environment and includes all necessary components for integration into a larger system.
