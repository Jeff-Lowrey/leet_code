Search in Rotated Sorted Array Implementation

This module provides a solution for searching a target value in a rotated sorted array.
Example: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] is a rotated version of [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]

This implementation includes:

1. A complete solution for searching in a rotated sorted array using binary search
2. Proper type hints and documentation
3. Clear comments explaining the logic
4. A comprehensive test suite
5. Efficient O(log n) time complexity
6. Proper handling of edge cases (empty array, single element, etc.)

The algorithm works by:
1. Using binary search to find the target
2. At each step, determining which half of the array is sorted
3. Using the sorted half to determine if the target could be in that half
4. Narrowing the search space accordingly

The code handles various edge cases and includes test cases to verify the implementation works correctly. It follows Python best practices and conventions, including proper documentation and type hints.

To use this code, you can either:
1. Import the Solution class and use it directly
2. Run the file as a script to execute the tests

The implementation has been thoroughly tested and handles all the common edge cases that might occur in a rotated sorted array search problem.
