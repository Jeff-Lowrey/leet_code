34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
Medium

Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting
and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example:
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Since we need O(log n) complexity on a sorted array, we must use binary search.
However, standard binary search finds ANY occurrence. We need to find the
FIRST and LAST occurrences specifically.

### KEY INSIGHT:
We can modify binary search to find boundaries:
- For first occurrence: when we find target, continue searching LEFT
- For last occurrence: when we find target, continue searching RIGHT

### APPROACH:
1. Use two separate binary searches
2. First search: find leftmost (first) occurrence
3. Second search: find rightmost (last) occurrence
4. Both searches maintain the O(log n) complexity

### FIRST OCCURRENCE ALGORITHM:
1. When nums[mid] == target: record position but search LEFT (right = mid - 1)
2. When nums[mid] < target: search RIGHT (left = mid + 1)
3. When nums[mid] > target: search LEFT (right = mid - 1)

### LAST OCCURRENCE ALGORITHM:
1. When nums[mid] == target: record position but search RIGHT (left = mid + 1)
2. When nums[mid] < target: search RIGHT (left = mid + 1)
3. When nums[mid] > target: search LEFT (right = mid - 1)

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8

Find first 8:
- Search continues left even after finding 8
- Eventually finds index 3

Find last 8:
- Search continues right even after finding 8
- Eventually finds index 4

Result: [3, 4]
```

### WHY TWO SEARCHES?
- Single binary search can't determine boundaries in one pass
- Two focused searches are still O(log n) each = O(log n) total
- Each search has a specific goal (leftmost vs rightmost)

162. Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -‚àû.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]

981. Time Based Key-Value Store
Medium

Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for
the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.

Implement the TimeMap class:
- TimeMap() Initializes the object of the data structure.
- void set(String key, String value, int timestamp) Stores the key with the value at the given time.
- String get(String key, int timestamp) Returns the value with timestamp_prev <= timestamp.
  If there are no values, return "".

Example:
Input:
["TimeMap", "set", "get", "get", "set", "get", "get"]
[[], ["foo", "bar", 1], ["foo", 1], ["foo", 3], ["foo", "bar2", 4], ["foo", 4], ["foo", 5]]
