I'll help you create a solution for the Minimum Arrows problem. This implementation will find the minimum number of arrows needed to burst balloons, where each balloon is represented by its start and end coordinates on a line.

Minimum Arrows Implementation

This module solves the problem of finding the minimum number of arrows needed
to burst all balloons, where balloons are represented by their start and end
coordinates on a line.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of balloons
Space Complexity: O(1) as we only use constant extra space

This implementation includes:

1. A complete solution class with the main algorithm implementation
2. Proper type hints and documentation
3. Comprehensive test cases
4. Clear comments explaining the logic
5. Example usage
6. Edge case handling

The algorithm works by:
1. Sorting balloons by their end coordinates
2. Keeping track of the current arrow position
3. Adding new arrows only when necessary (when a balloon starts after the current arrow position)

The solution is efficient with O(n log n) time complexity (due to sorting) and O(1) space complexity.

The file includes both the implementation and test cases, making it easy to verify the solution works correctly. You can run this file directly to see the test results and an example usage.
