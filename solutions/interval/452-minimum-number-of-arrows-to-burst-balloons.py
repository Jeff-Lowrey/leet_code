# Difficulty: Medium

# 452. Minimum Number Of Arrows To Burst Balloons

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>2 (minimum arrows)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Minimum 2 arrows needed to burst balloons at [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Sort balloons by end position. Use greedy: shoot arrow at the end of first balloon. Count balloons this arrow bursts (end >= balloon start). Move to first unbursted balloon. Count total arrows.

### APPROACH:
1. **Sort by end**: Sort balloons by end coordinate
2. **Initialize arrow**: Set arrows = 1, current_end = balloons[0][1]
3. **Iterate from second**: For each balloon in balloons[1:]
4. **Check if in range**: If balloon_start <= current_end, same arrow can burst it
5. **Need new arrow**: If balloon_start > current_end, increment arrows, update current_end
6. **Continue processing**: Handle all balloons
7. **Return result**: Return arrows as minimum arrows needed

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Sort by end coordinate: shoot arrow at earliest ending balloon
- Greedy: one arrow at end position can burst all overlapping balloons
- Count arrows: increment when balloon starts after last arrow position
- Earliest end maximizes number of balloons burst per arrow
- O(n log n) for sort, O(1) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Step 1: Sort by end position
  sorted = [[1,6],[2,8],[7,12],[10,16]]

Step 2: Greedy arrow placement
  Arrow at 6: bursts [1,6],[2,8]
  Arrow at 12: bursts [7,12],[10,16]

Output: 2 (minimum arrows)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
