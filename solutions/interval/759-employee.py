I'll help you create a solution for the Employee Free Time problem. This implementation will find the common free time intervals among all employees' schedules.

Employee Free Time - Python Implementation

This module provides a solution to find common free time intervals among multiple employees' schedules.
Each employee's schedule consists of intervals where they are busy, and we need to find the gaps
where all employees are free.

Time Complexity: O(N log N) where N is total number of intervals
Space Complexity: O(N) for storing merged intervals

This implementation includes:

1. A clear class structure with `Interval` class for representing time intervals
2. A `Solution` class with the main algorithm implementation
3. Helper functions for printing and testing
4. Proper type hints and documentation
5. Example usage in the `main()` function
6. Efficient algorithm using sorting and merging techniques
7. Edge case handling
8. Clear comments explaining the implementation

The algorithm works by:
1. Flattening all employee schedules into a single list
2. Sorting intervals by start time
3. Merging overlapping intervals
4. Finding gaps between merged intervals to identify free time

The solution handles various edge cases and follows Python best practices. The code is structured as a complete, runnable file that can be executed directly or imported as a module.
