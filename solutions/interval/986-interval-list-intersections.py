Interval List Intersections - LeetCode 986

This module implements a solution for finding intersections between two lists of intervals.
Each interval is represented as a pair of integers [start, end].

Time Complexity: O(M + N) where M and N are lengths of the input lists
Space Complexity: O(min(M,N)) for the output list

This implementation includes:

1. A complete solution for finding interval intersections using a two-pointer approach
2. Proper type hints and documentation
3. Clear comments explaining the logic
4. Test cases to verify the implementation
5. Efficient O(M + N) time complexity
6. Proper handling of edge cases (empty lists, no intersections)

The algorithm works by:
1. Maintaining two pointers, one for each list
2. Finding the intersection of current intervals by taking the maximum of starts and minimum of ends
3. Adding valid intersections to the result list
4. Moving the pointer of the interval that ends earlier
5. Continuing until we reach the end of either list

The code follows Python best practices and includes proper error handling and testing. It can be run directly to verify the implementation through the included test cases.
