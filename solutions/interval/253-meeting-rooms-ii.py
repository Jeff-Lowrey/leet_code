# 253. Meeting Rooms Ii

Given an array of meeting time intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of conference rooms required.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>2 (minimum meeting rooms needed)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Minimum 2 meeting rooms needed for [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Track meeting start and end times separately. Use min heap for end times. When a new meeting starts, remove all meetings that have already ended. Heap size is rooms needed at that moment. Return maximum heap size.

### APPROACH:
1. **Separate start and end times**: Create start_times and end_times arrays
2. **Sort both arrays**: Sort start_times and end_times independently
3. **Initialize pointers**: Set start_ptr = 0, end_ptr = 0, rooms = 0, max_rooms = 0
4. **Process all meetings**: While start_ptr < len(start_times)
5. **Meeting starts**: If start_times[start_ptr] < end_times[end_ptr], increment rooms and start_ptr
6. **Meeting ends**: Else decrement rooms and increment end_ptr
7. **Track maximum**: max_rooms = max(max_rooms, rooms)
8. **Return result**: Return max_rooms

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Sort start times and end times separately as two arrays
- Two pointers: when meeting starts before earliest end, need new room
- When meeting starts after earliest end, reuse that room
- Track maximum rooms needed simultaneously
- O(n log n) for sorting, O(n) space for separate arrays

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Step 1: Separate start and end times
  starts = [0,5,15]
  ends = [10,20,30]

Step 2: Use two pointers
  time=0: start meeting, rooms=1
  time=5: start meeting, rooms=2
  time=10: end meeting, rooms=1
  time=15: start meeting, rooms=2
  time=20: end meeting, rooms=1
  time=30: end meeting, rooms=0

Output: 2 (minimum meeting rooms needed)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
