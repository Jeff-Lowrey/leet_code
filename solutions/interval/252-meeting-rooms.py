Meeting Rooms - Python Implementation

This module provides a solution to determine if a person can attend all meetings
given a list of meeting time intervals. A person cannot attend overlapping meetings.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of meetings
Space Complexity: O(1) as we sort in place

This implementation includes:

1. A `Solution` class with the main method `can_attend_meetings`
2. Comprehensive documentation and type hints
3. A sorting-based approach to solve the problem efficiently
4. Test cases covering various scenarios
5. Example usage in the main block
6. Proper error handling and edge cases

The algorithm works by:
1. Sorting meetings by start time
2. Checking for any overlaps between consecutive meetings
3. Returning False if any overlap is found, True otherwise

The solution handles edge cases like empty input and single meetings appropriately. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and space complexity is O(1) as we sort in place.

To use this code, you can either:
1. Run it directly to execute the test cases
2. Import the Solution class and use it in your own code
3. Modify the example usage in the main block for your specific needs
