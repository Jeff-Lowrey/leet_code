I'll help you create a solution for the Minimum Arrows problem. I'll write a complete JavaScript implementation that follows best practices and includes proper documentation.

```javascript
/**
 * Minimum Arrows to Burst Balloons
 * 
 * Problem: Given an array of balloon intervals where intervals[i] = [start, end],
 * find the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all balloons.
 * An arrow can be shot up exactly once at any point and will burst all balloons
 * that contain that point.
 * 
 * @param {number[][]} points - Array of balloon intervals [start, end]
 * @return {number} - Minimum number of arrows needed
 */

const findMinArrowShots = function(points) {
    // Handle edge cases
    if (!points || points.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    if (points.length === 1) {
        return 1;
    }

    // Sort points based on end position
    points.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);
    
    let arrows = 1;  // Start with one arrow
    let currentEnd = points[0][1];  // Track the current arrow position
    
    // Iterate through all points
    for (let i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
        // If current balloon starts after the last arrow position
        // we need a new arrow
        if (points[i][0] > currentEnd) {
            arrows++;
            currentEnd = points[i][1];
        }
        // Otherwise, current balloon can be burst by the previous arrow
    }
    
    return arrows;
};

// Test cases
const testCases = [
    [[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]],
    [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6], [7,8]],
    [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,5]],
    [],
    [[1,2]]
];

// Run test cases
testCases.forEach((test, index) => {
    console.log(`Test Case ${index + 1}:`);
    console.log(`Input: ${JSON.stringify(test)}`);
    console.log(`Output: ${findMinArrowShots(test)}`);
    console.log('---');
});

// Export the function for potential module usage
module.exports = {
    findMinArrowShots
};
```

This implementation includes:

1. A well-documented solution with clear comments explaining the approach
2. Efficient algorithm using sorting and greedy approach
3. Proper handling of edge cases (empty array, single balloon)
4. Test cases to verify the implementation
5. Module exports for potential reuse
6. Clean code structure following JavaScript conventions

The algorithm works by:
1. Sorting balloons by their end positions
2. Keeping track of the current arrow position
3. Only adding a new arrow when we can't burst the current balloon with existing arrows

The time complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting, and space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

The code handles various scenarios including:
- Empty input
- Single balloon
- Multiple overlapping balloons
- Non-overlapping balloons
- Sequential balloons

The test cases demonstrate the functionality with different input scenarios.
