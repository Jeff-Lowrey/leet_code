I'll help you create a solution for the Non-Overlapping Intervals problem. I'll write a complete JavaScript implementation that meets all the requirements.

```javascript
/**
 * Non-Overlapping Intervals
 * 
 * Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], 
 * return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make 
 * the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
 * 
 * @param {number[][]} intervals - Array of interval pairs
 * @return {number} - Minimum number of intervals to remove
 */

function eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals) {
    // Handle edge cases
    if (!intervals || intervals.length <= 1) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Sort intervals by end time
    // This helps in making greedy choice by considering intervals
    // that end earlier first
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);

    let count = 0;          // Count of intervals to remove
    let prevEnd = -Infinity; // End time of previous non-overlapping interval

    // Iterate through sorted intervals
    for (const [start, end] of intervals) {
        // If current interval starts before or at previous end,
        // we have an overlap and need to remove one interval
        if (start < prevEnd) {
            count++;
        } else {
            // No overlap, update prevEnd to current interval's end
            prevEnd = end;
        }
    }

    return count;
}

/**
 * Test cases to verify the implementation
 */
function runTests() {
    const testCases = [
        {
            input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3]],
            expected: 1,
            description: "Test case 1: Basic overlapping intervals"
        },
        {
            input: [[1,2], [1,2], [1,2]],
            expected: 2,
            description: "Test case 2: Multiple identical intervals"
        },
        {
            input: [[1,2], [2,3]],
            expected: 0,
            description: "Test case 3: Non-overlapping intervals"
        },
        {
            input: [],
            expected: 0,
            description: "Test case 4: Empty array"
        }
    ];

    testCases.forEach((testCase, index) => {
        const result = eraseOverlapIntervals(testCase.input);
        console.log(`${testCase.description}`);
        console.log(`Input: ${JSON.stringify(testCase.input)}`);
        console.log(`Expected: ${testCase.expected}`);
        console.log(`Got: ${result}`);
        console.log(`Test ${result === testCase.expected ? 'PASSED' : 'FAILED'}\n`);
    });
}

// Export the function for potential use in other modules
module.exports = {
    eraseOverlapIntervals
};

// Run tests if this file is being run directly
if (require.main === module) {
    runTests();
}
```

This implementation includes:

1. A main function `eraseOverlapIntervals` that solves the non-overlapping intervals problem using a greedy approach
2. Comprehensive error handling and edge cases
3. Clear comments explaining the logic and implementation
4. Test cases to verify the implementation
5. Proper module exports for reusability
6. Following JavaScript best practices and conventions

The algorithm works by:
1. Sorting intervals by end time
2. Greedily selecting non-overlapping intervals
3. Counting the minimum number of intervals that need to be removed

The time complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting, and space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

The code includes test cases that cover various scenarios including:
- Basic overlapping intervals
- Multiple identical intervals
- Non-overlapping intervals
- Empty input array

The implementation is complete and ready to be saved to the specified file path.
