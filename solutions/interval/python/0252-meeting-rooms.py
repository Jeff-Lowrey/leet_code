# 252. Meeting Rooms

Given an array of meeting time intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], determine if a person could attend all meetings.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>False (cannot attend all meetings)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>The person can attend all meetings because [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]] has overlaps (cannot attend all)</dd>
</dl>

<details>
<summary><b>🔍 SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>### METADATA:
**Techniques**: Hash Table Lookup, Hash Map Storage, Array Traversal
**Data Structures**: Hash Map, Array, Linked List
**Patterns**: Two Pointers Pattern
**Time Complexity**: O(n) - Single pass through input
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - Constant extra space

### INTUITION:
Sort meetings by start time. Check consecutive meetings for overlap by comparing start of next meeting with end of current. If any overlap, return false.

### APPROACH:
1. **Sort by start time**: Sort intervals by interval[0]
2. **Check consecutive pairs**: For i in range(1, len(intervals))
3. **Check overlap**: If intervals[i][0] < intervals[i-1][1], overlap exists
4. **Return False**: Overlapping meetings cannot be attended
5. **Continue checking**: Process all pairs
6. **Return True**: If no overlaps found

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Sort by start time, check consecutive intervals for overlap
- Overlap if current.start < previous.end
- Single overlap means person can't attend all meetings
- Sorting ensures we check all potential conflicts
- O(n log n) for sort, O(1) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
Input:
```
intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
```

Step 1: Sort by start time
sorted = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Step 2: Check for overlaps

Steps:
Step 1: [0,30] vs [5,10]: 5 < 30 → overlap found

Output:
```
False (cannot attend all meetings)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
