# 435. Non Overlapping Intervals

Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>1 (min intervals to remove)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Minimum 1 interval removed to make [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]] non-overlapping</dd>
</dl>

### INTUITION:
Sort by end time (greedy). Keep track of previous interval's end. If current start >= previous end, intervals don't overlap. Otherwise, skip current interval (remove it). Count removals.

### APPROACH:
1. **Sort by end time**: Sort intervals by interval[1]
2. **Initialize variables**: Set count = 0, prev_end = intervals[0][1]
3. **Iterate from second**: For each interval in intervals[1:]
4. **Check overlap**: If current_start < prev_end, intervals overlap
5. **Remove current**: Increment count
6. **No overlap**: Update prev_end = current_end
7. **Return count**: Return count as minimum intervals to remove

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Sort by end time: greedy choice is interval finishing earliest
- Always pick interval with earliest end to leave room for more intervals
- Count overlaps: if start < last_end, remove current (increment count)
- Greedy works: earliest end maximizes remaining space for future intervals
- O(n log n) for sorting, O(1) space excluding input

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Step 1: Sort by end time
  sorted = [[1,2],[2,3],[1,3],[3,4]]

Step 2: Greedy selection
  Select [1,2], end=2
  [2,3]: 2 ‚â• 2, select it, end=3
  [1,3]: 1 < 3, overlaps ‚Üí remove count=1
  [3,4]: 3 ‚â• 3, select it

Output: 1 (min intervals to remove)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
