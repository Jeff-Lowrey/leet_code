I'll help you create a solution for the Merge Intervals problem that meets all the requirements. Here's the implementation:

Merge Intervals - Python Implementation
This module provides a solution to merge overlapping intervals.

Example:
    Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
    Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

This implementation:

1. Provides a clean, well-structured solution with proper class and method definitions
2. Includes necessary imports (typing for type hints)
3. Contains detailed comments explaining the implementation and complexity
4. Follows Python best practices (PEP 8 conventions)
5. Includes a complete, runnable file with test cases
6. Handles edge cases (empty input, single interval)

The solution uses a sorting-based approach:
1. First sorts intervals by start time
2. Then iterates through the intervals, merging overlapping ones
3. Returns the final merged list

The code includes comprehensive test cases and can be run directly to verify the implementation. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting, and space complexity is O(n) for the output array.
