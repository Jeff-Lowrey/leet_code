I'll help you implement the House Robber solution in Python. Here's a complete implementation with comments and proper structure:

LeetCode 198 - House Robber

Problem:
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has
a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a row.
You cannot rob adjacent houses. Find the maximum amount of money you can rob.

Example:
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

This implementation includes:

1. A complete solution to the House Robber problem using dynamic programming
2. Proper documentation with docstrings explaining the problem and solution
3. Type hints for better code readability and IDE support
4. A test function with multiple test cases to verify the solution
5. Efficient O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
6. Proper handling of edge cases (empty list, single house, two houses)
7. Clean code structure following Python conventions
8. Main guard to allow both importing and direct execution

The solution uses a dynamic programming approach with constant space complexity by maintaining only two variables to track the maximum possible money that can be robbed. The algorithm makes locally optimal choices at each step to achieve the globally optimal solution.

The test cases cover various scenarios including:
- Normal cases with multiple houses
- Edge cases (empty array, single house)
- Small arrays with 2-3 houses
- Arrays with different patterns of values

You can save this code to the specified path and run it directly to verify the implementation works correctly.
