I'll help you create a Python implementation for finding the longest increasing subsequence. I'll write a complete solution with comments and proper structure.

This implementation provides two different approaches to solve the Longest Increasing Subsequence problem:

1. Dynamic Programming Solution (O(nÂ²))
2. Binary Search Solution (O(n log n))

The code includes:
- Type hints for better code readability and IDE support
- Comprehensive comments explaining the implementation
- Proper error handling for edge cases
- Test cases in the main function
- Both classical DP and optimized binary search approaches
- Clean code structure following Python conventions

The file can be run directly to see the results of various test cases, or the class can be imported and used in other modules.

To use this code, you can either:
1. Run it directly: `python generated/DP-300-PY_longest_increasing___python_implementation.py`
2. Import the class: `from generated.DP-300-PY_longest_increasing___python_implementation import LongestIncreasingSubsequence`

The implementation handles edge cases such as:
- Empty arrays
- Arrays with single elements
- Arrays with duplicate elements
- Arrays with decreasing sequences
- Standard cases with multiple increasing subsequences
