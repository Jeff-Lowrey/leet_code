LeetCode 139 - Word Break Problem Implementation

This module provides a solution to determine if a string can be segmented into
words from a given dictionary using dynamic programming.

Time Complexity: O(n^2) where n is the length of the input string

This implementation includes:

1. A clean, well-structured solution with proper documentation
2. Two implementations: basic and optimized versions
3. Type hints and docstrings following Python conventions
4. Comprehensive comments explaining the logic
5. A main function with test cases
6. Proper handling of edge cases
7. Time and space complexity analysis

The solution uses dynamic programming to solve the Word Break problem efficiently. The basic version has a time complexity of O(nÂ²) and space complexity of O(n), while the optimized version includes additional pruning based on word lengths to improve average-case performance.

The code can be run directly as a script or imported as a module. It includes test cases to demonstrate functionality and verify that both implementations produce the same results.
