# Difficulty: Easy

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you
climb to the top?

Example:
Input: `n` = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.

**Example:**

<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>n` = 3</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>3</dd>

### INTUITION:
This is the classic Fibonacci problem in `disguise! To` reach step `n`, you can
either come from step (`n-1`) by taking 1 step, or from step (`n-2`) by taking 2 steps.
So: ways(n) = ways(`n-1`) + ways(`n-2`)

### APPROACH:
1. Base cases: ways(1)=1, ways(2)=2
2. For any step n: ways(n) = ways(`n-1`) + ways(`n-2`)
3. Use `bottom-up` DP to avoid redundant calculations

### WHY THIS WORKS:
The recurrence relation ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2) is valid because the only ways to reach step n are by taking a 1-step from step n-1 or a 2-step from step n-2. These are mutually exclusive paths, so we can add them together. By starting with the base cases and building up to n, we ensure every subproblem is solved exactly once, avoiding the exponential time complexity of naive recursion.

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: n = 3
Step 1: Build DP table
  dp[0] = 1 (0 steps: 1 way)
  dp[1] = 1 (1 step: one 1-step)
  dp[2] = 2 (2 steps: two 1-steps or one 2-step)
  dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 2 + 1 = 3

Step 2: Enumerate paths for verification
  Path 1: 1+1+1
  Path 2: 1+2
  Path 3: 2+1

Output: 3 (ways to climb)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)
Single pass from 3 to n, constant work per iteration

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)
Only store two variables (prev1, prev2), not full DP array

### EDGE CASES:
- n = 1: return 1 (one way)
- n = 2: return 2 (two ways)
- Large n: Fibonacci grows exponentially but algorithm is linear
- n = 0: not in problem constraints
