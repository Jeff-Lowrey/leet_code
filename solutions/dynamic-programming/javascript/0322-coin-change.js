/**
 * # 322. Coin Change
 *
 * # Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations
 * and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
 *
 * Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that
 * amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, `return -1`.
 *
 * You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: coins = [1,2,5], `amount = 11`
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 11 = `5 + 5` + 1
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>coins = [1,2,5], `amount = 11`</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>3</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>Minimum coins to make amount 11 using [1,2,5] is 3 coins: 5+5+1</dd>
 * </dl>

 * <details>
 * <summary><b>🔍 SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary> * ### METADATA:
 * **Techniques**: Hash Map Storage, Array Traversal, Memoization
 * **Data Structures**: Array
 * **Patterns**: Greedy Algorithm, Dynamic Programming
 * **Time Complexity**: * O(amount × len(coins))
 * **Space Complexity**: * O(amount)

 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * This is a classic "minimum path to `target`" DP problem. For any amount, we want
 * the minimum coins needed. We can build this up from smaller amounts.
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Initialize DP array**: Create array of size (amount + 1) filled with infinity, representing minimum coins needed for each amount
 * 2. **Set base case**: Set dp[0] = 0 (zero coins needed to make amount 0)
 * 3. **Iterate through amounts**: For each amount from 1 to target, calculate minimum coins needed
 * 4. **Try each coin**: For current amount i, try using each coin denomination that doesn't exceed i
 * 5. **Update DP value**: For each valid coin, calculate dp[i - coin] + 1 and take minimum across all coins
 * 6. **Build up solution**: Each dp[i] is built from previously computed smaller amounts (bottom-up dynamic programming)
 * 7. **Return result**: Return dp[amount] if reachable (not infinity), otherwise return -1 (impossible to make amount)
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * Using BFS with a queue processes nodes level by level. Tracking level size ensures we group nodes correctly. This works because BFS naturally visits nodes in level order, and we can identify level boundaries by counting nodes in the queue at each level's start.
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * Input:
 * ```
 * coins = [1,2,5], `amount = 11`
 * ```
 *
 * dp[0] = 0
 * dp[1] = 1 (use coin 1)
 * dp[2] = 1 (use coin 2)
 * dp[3] = 2 (use coin `2 + coin` 1)
 * dp[4] = 2 (use coin `2 + coin` 2)
 * dp[5] = 1 (use coin 5)
 * dp[6] = 2 (use coin `5 + coin` 1)
 * ...
 * dp[11] = 3 (use coin `5 + coin` `5 + coin` 1)

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(amount × len(coins))
 * For each amount from 1 to target, try all coins
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(amount)
 * DP array of size amount + 1
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - Amount is 0: return 0 (no coins needed)
 * - No solution possible: return -1
 * - Single coin type: straightforward calculation
 * - Large amounts: DP handles efficiently
