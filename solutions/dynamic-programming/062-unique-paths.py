# 062. Unique Paths

There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>m = 3, n = 2 (3 rows, 2 columns)</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>3 (number of unique paths)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Number of paths in 3√ó7 grid is 28</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Paths to cell (i,j) = paths to (i-1,j) + paths to (i,j-1). Build bottom-up from top-left. Base case: first row and column each have only 1 path.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize DP table**: Create 2D array dp[m][n] where dp[i][j] = number of paths to cell (i,j)
2. **Set base cases**: Fill first row and first column with 1 (only one way to reach each)
3. **Apply recurrence relation**: For each cell dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
4. **Build bottom-up**: Iterate through rows and columns, computing paths from top-left
5. **Sum incoming paths**: Each cell's count equals sum of paths from cell above and cell to left
6. **Continue to bottom-right**: Fill entire table until reaching dp[m-1][n-1]
7. **Return result**: Return dp[m-1][n-1] as total unique paths to bottom-right corner

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- DP: paths to (i,j) = paths to (i-1,j) + paths to (i,j-1)
- Base case: dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 1 (only one path along edges)
- Space optimization: only need previous row, not entire 2D array
- Combinatorics alternative: C(m+n-2, m-1) paths total
- O(m*n) time, O(n) space with optimized 1D DP

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 2 (3 rows, 2 columns)
Step 1: Create DP table
  dp[i][j] = number of paths to reach cell (i,j)

  dp = [[1, 1],
        [1, 2],
        [1, 3]]

Step 2: Fill table using dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
  dp[0][0] = 1 (starting point)
  dp[0][1] = 1 (can only go right)
  dp[1][0] = 1 (can only go down)
  dp[1][1] = dp[0][1] + dp[1][0] = 1 + 1 = 2
  dp[2][0] = 1
  dp[2][1] = dp[1][1] + dp[2][0] = 2 + 1 = 3

Output: 3 (number of unique paths)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
