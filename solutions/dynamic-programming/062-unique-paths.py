I'll help you implement a solution for the Unique Paths problem in Python. This solution will use dynamic programming to calculate the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid.

Unique Paths - Dynamic Programming Solution
-----------------------------------------
Problem: Calculate the number of unique paths from top-left to bottom-right corner
of an m x n grid, where you can only move right or down at any point.

Time Complexity: O(m*n)
Space Complexity: O(m*n) - can be optimized to O(n)

This implementation includes:

1. A standard solution using 2D dynamic programming (`uniquePaths`)
2. An optimized solution using 1D array (`uniquePathsOptimized`)
3. Comprehensive test cases
4. Clear documentation and comments
5. Proper Python conventions and structure

The solution uses dynamic programming to build up the number of possible paths to each cell. The key insight is that the number of paths to any cell is the sum of paths from the cell above it and the cell to its left.

The optimized version reduces space complexity from O(m*n) to O(n) by using only a single row array and updating it in place.

To use this code:
1. Save it to the specified path
2. Run it directly to execute the tests
3. Import the Solution class to use in other code

The code handles edge cases and includes assertions to verify correct functionality.
