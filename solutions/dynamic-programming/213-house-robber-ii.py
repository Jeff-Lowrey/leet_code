I'll help you implement the House Robber II solution in Python. This problem is similar to House Robber I but with houses arranged in a circle. Here's the complete implementation:

LeetCode 213 - House Robber II

Problem: Given a list of non-negative integers representing money in houses arranged in a circle,
determine the maximum amount that can be robbed without robbing adjacent houses and considering
that the first and last houses are adjacent.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

This implementation includes:

1. A complete solution to the House Robber II problem
2. Clear documentation and comments explaining the approach
3. Type hints for better code readability
4. Helper method to solve the linear house robber problem
5. Test cases to verify the solution
6. Proper handling of edge cases
7. Time and space complexity analysis

The solution uses dynamic programming with constant space complexity by maintaining only two variables to keep track of the maximum amount that can be robbed. The main difference from House Robber I is that we need to handle the circular arrangement by considering two separate cases:
1. Rob houses from index 0 to n-2 (excluding last house)
2. Rob houses from index 1 to n-1 (excluding first house)

The maximum of these two cases gives us the final answer.

The code follows Python best practices and conventions, including proper typing, docstrings, and test cases. It can be run directly to verify the implementation works correctly.
