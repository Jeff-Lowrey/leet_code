# 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
**Medium**

You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children.
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Use level-order traversal (BFS) to connect nodes at the same level.
For each level, link each node to the next node in the queue.

### APPROACH:
1. **Handle edge case**: Return root if tree is empty
2. **Initialize BFS**: Use a deque with root node
3. **For each level**:
   - Record level size
   - Process all nodes at current level
   - Connect each node to the next node in same level
   - Last node in level points to NULL (already set)
   - Add children to queue for next level

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- BFS processes nodes level by level, left to right
- Within each level, nodes are in the queue in left-to-right order
- By connecting each node to the next node in queue (at same level), we establish next pointers
- Last node of each level naturally has next = NULL

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
- Visit each node exactly once
- n = number of nodes in tree

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(w)
- Queue holds at most one level of nodes at a time
- w = maximum width of tree (for perfect tree: n/2 at last level)

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Tree:        1
           /   \
          2     3
         / \   / \
        4   5 6   7

After connecting:
Level 0: 1 -> NULL
Level 1: 2 -> 3 -> NULL
Level 2: 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> NULL
```

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty tree: Return None
- Single node: Return node with next = NULL
- Perfect binary tree: All levels fully connected

### ALTERNATIVE APPROACH (O(1) Space):
Using the next pointers established at level i to connect level i+1 without a queue.
