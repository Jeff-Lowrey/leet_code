/**

 *
 * This problem demonstrates key concepts in String Manipulation.
 *
 * SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
 *
 * INTUITION:
 * The count-and-say sequence is generated by reading the previous term and describing it.
 * Each term describes the previous term by counting consecutive identical digits.
 *
 * APPROACH:


 *    - Count consecutive identical characters
 *    - Append count + character to the result

 *
 * WHY THIS WORKS:
 * We iterate through the string, counting consecutive identical characters,
 * and build the next sequence by saying the count followed by the digit.
 *
 * TIME COMPLEXITY: O(2^n)
 * - Each iteration can potentially double the length of the string
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(2^n)
 * - We need to store the result string which grows exponentially
 *
 * EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * n = 1: "1"
 * n = 2: "11" (one 1)
 * n = 3: "21" (two 1s)
 * n = 4: "1211" (one 2, one 1)
 * n = 5: "111221" (one 1, one 2, two 1s)
 *
 * EDGE CASES:
 * - n = 1: Return "1"
 * - Large n values: Exponential growth in string length
