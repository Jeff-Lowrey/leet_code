# Difficulty: Medium

Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string s. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars:
- If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.
- Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead, be stored in the
input character array chars. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split
into multiple characters in chars.

After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

Example:
Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Compressed string ['a','a','b','b','c','c','c'] becomes ['a','2','b','2','c','3'] with length 6</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
We need to compress consecutive identical characters in-place. The key insight is using
two pointers: one to read through the array, and one to write the compressed result back
to the same array. This allows us to modify the array in-place with O(1) extra space.

### APPROACH:
1. **Two Pointers**: Use `read` pointer to scan array, `write` pointer for result
2. **Count Consecutive**: For each character, count how many consecutive times it appears
3. **Write Character**: Always write the character itself
4. **Write Count**: If count > 1, write the count digits
5. **Handle Multi-Digit Counts**: Split counts like 12 into '1', '2'

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Writing pointer never overtakes reading pointer (compressed is always shorter)
- We process characters left to right in a single pass
- In-place modification is safe because we consume input faster than we produce output
- Converting count to string and iterating over digits handles multi-digit counts

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

Read pointer scans:
1. chars[0-1]: 'a' appears 2 times
   Write: chars[0]='a', chars[1]='2'
   write=2

2. chars[2-3]: 'b' appears 2 times
   Write='b', chars[3]='2'
   write=4

3. chars[4-6]: 'c' appears 3 times
   Write='c', chars[5]='3'
   write=6

Result: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"] with length 6
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)
- Single pass through the array with read pointer
- Writing compressed data is proportional to input size

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)
- Only using constant extra space (pointers and counters)
- Modifying the array in-place

### EDGE CASES:
- Single character: Return 1
- All different characters: Return original length
- All same characters: Return 1 + len(str(count))
- Very long runs (count >= 10): Multi-digit handling
