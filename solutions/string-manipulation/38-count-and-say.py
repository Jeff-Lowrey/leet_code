38. Count and Say
# Difficulty: Medium
The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:
- countAndSay(1) = "1"
- countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1),
  which is then converted into a different digit string.

To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of substrings
such that each substring contains exactly one unique digit. Then for each substring,
say the number of digits, then say the digit. Finally, concatenate every said digit.

Example:
Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation:
countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1s = "21"
countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "1211"

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
The count-and-say sequence is built iteratively where each term describes the previous term
by counting consecutive identical digits. We read the previous result from left to right,
counting how many times each digit appears consecutively, then building a new string.

### APPROACH:
1. **Base Case**: Start with "1" for n=1
2. **Iterative Building**: For each iteration from 2 to n:
   - Read through the previous string
   - Count consecutive occurrences of each digit
   - Build new string by appending count + digit
3. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use two pointers to identify runs of same digits
4. **String Construction**: Use list for efficient string building

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Each term is uniquely determined by the previous term
- We process left to right, counting consecutive identical digits
- The pattern is deterministic and follows a clear rule
- Building with a list and joining is efficient in Python

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n * m)
- n iterations to build up to the nth term
- m is the length of the string at each iteration (grows exponentially)
- Each iteration processes the entire string once

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(m)
- m is the length of the current string
- We store the result string which grows with each iteration

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
n = 5:
1. "1"
2. "11" (one 1)
3. "21" (two 1s)
4. "1211" (one 2, one 1)
5. "111221" (one 1, one 2, two 1s)

For "1211" ‚Üí "111221":
- Read '1' once: "11"
- Read '2' once: "12"
- Read '1' twice: "21"
- Result: "111221"
```

### KEY INSIGHTS:
- The sequence never contains digits other than 1, 2, and 3
- The string length grows roughly by 30% each iteration
- We only need to track consecutive runs of digits
- Use list accumulation for efficient string building

### EDGE CASES:
- n = 1: Return "1" directly
- Long sequences: String grows exponentially
- All same digits: Still processed character by character
