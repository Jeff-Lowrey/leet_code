# 284. Peeking Iterator

Design an iterator that supports the peek operation on an existing iterator in addition to the hasNext and the next operations.

Implement the PeekingIterator class:
- PeekingIterator(Iterator<int> iterator) Initializes the object with the given integer iterator iterator.
- int next() Returns the next element in the array and moves the pointer to the next element.
- boolean hasNext() Returns true if there are still elements in the array.
- int peek() Returns the next element in the array without moving the pointer.

Note: Each language may have a different implementation of the constructor and Iterator, but they all support the int next() and boolean hasNext() functions.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>
["PeekingIterator", "next", "peek", "next", "next", "hasNext"]<br>
[[[1, 2, 3]], [], [], [], [], []]
</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>[null, 1, 2, 2, 3, false]</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>
PeekingIterator peekingIterator = new PeekingIterator([1, 2, 3]); // [1,2,3]<br>
peekingIterator.next();    // return 1, the pointer moves to the next element [1,2,3].<br>
peekingIterator.peek();    // return 2, the pointer does not move [1,2,3].<br>
peekingIterator.next();    // return 2, the pointer moves to the next element [1,2,3]<br>
peekingIterator.next();    // return 3, the pointer moves to the next element [1,2,3]<br>
peekingIterator.hasNext(); // return False
</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
The challenge is to add a peek() operation that returns the next element without advancing the iterator. We need to cache the next element to support this functionality while maintaining compatibility with the original iterator interface.

### APPROACH:
1. **Cache next element**: Store the upcoming element when needed
2. **Track cached state**: Know when we have a cached element vs need to fetch
3. **Peek operation**: Return cached element without advancing
4. **Next operation**: Return cached element (if exists) or fetch from iterator
5. **HasNext operation**: Check if cached element exists or iterator has more

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Caching allows us to "look ahead" without consuming the iterator
- State tracking ensures we don't double-consume elements
- All operations maintain O(1) complexity
- Original iterator interface is preserved

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Iterator: [1,2,3]
PeekingIterator created
peek() ‚Üí 1 (cache element 1, don't advance)
next() ‚Üí 1 (return cached element, advance iterator)
peek() ‚Üí 2 (cache element 2, don't advance)
peek() ‚Üí 2 (return same cached element)
next() ‚Üí 2 (return cached element, advance iterator)
hasNext() ‚Üí true (iterator still has element 3)
next() ‚Üí 3 (fetch from iterator)
hasNext() ‚Üí false
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(1)
All operations are constant time

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)
Only storing one cached element

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty iterator (hasNext() returns false immediately)
- Single element iterator (works correctly with cache)
- Multiple consecutive peek() calls (returns same element)
- peek() then next() (peek doesn't consume, next does)
- Calling peek() when hasNext() is false (undefined behavior, should check first)
