I'll help you implement a BST Iterator in Python. Here's a clean and well-documented solution:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class BSTIterator:
    """
    Binary Search Tree Iterator implementation that provides next() and hasNext() operations.
    Uses controlled recursion with a stack to achieve O(h) space complexity, where h is the height of the tree.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, root: TreeNode):
        """
        Initialize the iterator with the root node of BST.
        Time complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the tree
        Space complexity: O(h) to store the stack
        
        Args:
            root: Root node of the Binary Search Tree
        """
        # Initialize an empty stack to store nodes
        self.stack = []
        
        # Helper function to push all left nodes onto stack
        def _push_left(node):
            while node:
                self.stack.append(node)
                node = node.left
        
        # Push all leftmost nodes onto stack starting from root
        _push_left(root)
    
    def next(self) -> int:
        """
        Returns the next smallest number in the BST.
        Time complexity: Amortized O(1)
        Space complexity: O(1)
        
        Returns:
            The value of the next smallest element in the BST
        """
        # Pop the next smallest element (top of stack)
        current = self.stack.pop()
        
        # If this node has a right child,
        # push all left nodes of the right subtree onto stack
        if current.right:
            node = current.right
            while node:
                self.stack.append(node)
                node = node.left
        
        return current.val
    
    def hasNext(self) -> bool:
        """
        Returns whether the next element exists.
        Time complexity: O(1)
        Space complexity: O(1)
        
        Returns:
            True if there are still elements in the BST to iterate over, False otherwise
        """
        return len(self.stack) > 0


# Example usage:
def main():
    # Create a sample BST
    #       7
    #      / \
    #     3   15
    #        /  \
    #       9    20
    
    root = TreeNode(7)
    root.left = TreeNode(3)
    root.right = TreeNode(15)
    root.right.left = TreeNode(9)
    root.right.right = TreeNode(20)
    
    # Initialize iterator
    iterator = BSTIterator(root)
    
    # Test the iterator
    print(iterator.next())    # returns 3
    print(iterator.next())    # returns 7
    print(iterator.hasNext()) # returns True
    print(iterator.next())    # returns 9
    print(iterator.hasNext()) # returns True
    print(iterator.next())    # returns 15
    print(iterator.next())    # returns 20
    print(iterator.hasNext()) # returns False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation provides:

1. A `TreeNode` class for the basic structure of BST nodes
2. A `BSTIterator` class with three main methods:
   - `__init__`: Initializes the iterator and sets up the initial stack
   - `next`: Returns the next smallest number in the BST
   - `hasNext`: Checks if there are more elements to iterate over

Key features of this implementation:

1. Space Complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the tree
2. Time Complexity: 
   - Constructor: O(h)
   - next(): Amortized O(1)
   - hasNext(): O(1)

3. Uses a stack-based approach to maintain the state of iteration
4. Follows the in-order traversal pattern (left -> root -> right)
5. Handles edge cases (empty tree, single node, etc.)
6. Includes comprehensive comments explaining the implementation
7. Provides example usage in the main function

The implementation follows Python best practices and conventions, including proper documentation, clear variable names, and appropriate spacing.
