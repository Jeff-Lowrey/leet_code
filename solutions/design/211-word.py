I'll help you create a Word Dictionary implementation in Python that meets the requirements. Here's the complete solution:

This implementation provides a complete solution for a Word Dictionary with the following features:

1. Uses a Trie (prefix tree) data structure for efficient storage and lookup
2. Supports adding words through the `addWord` method
3. Supports searching words with wildcard pattern matching through the `search` method
4. Includes proper documentation and comments
5. Follows Python best practices and conventions
6. Includes a main function with example usage
7. Handles edge cases appropriately

The code is structured into two main classes:
- `TrieNode`: Represents a node in the Trie data structure
- `WordDictionary`: Main class that implements the dictionary functionality

The solution efficiently handles:
- Word insertion with O(m) complexity where m is the word length
- Word search with O(m) complexity for exact matches
- Pattern matching with wildcards using depth-first search

The implementation is complete and ready to use, with example usage provided in the `main()` function.
