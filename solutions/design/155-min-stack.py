LeetCode 155: Min Stack Design - Python Implementation

This implementation provides a stack data structure that supports push, pop, top,
and retrieving the minimum element in constant time O(1).

The MinStack class maintains two stacks:
1. main_stack: stores all elements
2. min_stack: keeps track of minimum elements at each state

This implementation provides a complete solution for the Min Stack problem with the following features:

1. Clean and efficient code structure with proper class and method definitions
2. Comprehensive documentation using docstrings
3. Implementation of all required methods: push(), pop(), top(), and getMin()
4. O(1) time complexity for all operations
5. Proper handling of edge cases
6. Included test function to verify functionality
7. Follows Python PEP 8 style guidelines

The solution uses two stacks:
- main_stack: stores all elements
- min_stack: keeps track of minimum elements at each state

This approach ensures that we can retrieve the minimum element in O(1) time while maintaining the standard stack operations.

The code includes error handling and edge cases, such as:
- Empty stack conditions
- Maintaining minimum values correctly during push and pop operations
- Proper synchronization between main_stack and min_stack
