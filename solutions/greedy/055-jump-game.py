55. Jump Game
Medium

You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's
first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length
at that position.

Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

Example:
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Use greedy approach to track the farthest position we can reach. If at any point our current position exceeds the farthest reachable position, we can't proceed further.

### APPROACH (Greedy):
1. **Track max_reach** - the farthest index we can reach so far
2. **For each position i**:
   - If i > max_reach, we can't reach this position ‚Üí return False
   - Update max_reach = max(max_reach, i + nums[i])
   - If max_reach ‚â• last index ‚Üí return True

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- We only need to know if the last index is reachable, not the actual path
- Greedy choice: always try to reach the farthest possible position
- If we can reach position i, and from i we can jump nums[i] steps, then we can reach any position up to i + nums[i]

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)

### THREE APPROACHES:

#### Approach 1: Forward Greedy (Optimal)
Track maximum reachable position while moving forward

#### Approach 2: Backward Greedy
Start from end, work backwards to see if position 0 can reach the end

#### Approach 3: Dynamic Programming
Use DP array to track reachability of each position

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH (Forward Greedy):
```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]

i=0: max_reach = max(0, 0+2) = 2
     Can reach indices 0,1,2

i=1: max_reach = max(2, 1+3) = 4
     Can reach indices 0,1,2,3,4
     Since 4 ‚â• last index (4), return True

Alternative example: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]

i=0: max_reach = max(0, 0+3) = 3
i=1: max_reach = max(3, 1+2) = 3
i=2: max_reach = max(3, 2+1) = 3
i=3: max_reach = max(3, 3+0) = 3
i=4: 4 > 3 (max_reach), so position 4 is unreachable ‚Üí return False
```

### BACKWARD GREEDY INTUITION:
```
Start from last position, work backwards:
- Find positions that can reach the current "good" position
- If position 0 becomes "good", then we can reach the end
```

### KEY INSIGHT:
Greedy works because if we can reach the farthest possible position at each step, we maximize our chances of reaching the end. We don't need to consider suboptimal intermediate positions.
