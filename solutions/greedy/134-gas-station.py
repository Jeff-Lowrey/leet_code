# 134. Gas Station
# Difficulty: Medium
There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the
ith station is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel
from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an
empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if
you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.
If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
This problem can be solved greedily by recognizing two key insights:
1. If the total gas is less than total cost, completing the circuit is impossible
2. If we run out of gas at station i when starting from station j, then no station
   between j and i can be a valid starting point

### APPROACH:
1. **Check feasibility**: If sum(gas) < sum(cost), return -1
2. **Track current gas**: Simulate traveling and track current gas level
3. **Reset when negative**: When gas becomes negative, the next station becomes
   the new candidate starting point
4. **Greedy choice**: We don't need to check previous stations again because if
   starting from j fails at i, then j+1, j+2, ..., i-1 will also fail

### WHY THIS WORKS (PROOF):
- **Claim 1**: If total_gas >= total_cost, a solution exists
- **Claim 2**: If we can't reach station i from station j, then we can't reach
  station i from any station between j and i
- **Proof of Claim 2**:
  - Let's say we start at j and reach station k (where j < k < i) with gas_k > 0
  - If starting from j fails at i, then starting from k also fails at i
  - Why? Because we have less gas starting from k than we would have if we
    started from j and reached k
  - Starting from j: gas_k = (gas[j] - cost[j]) + (gas[j+1] - cost[j+1]) + ...
  - Starting from k: gas_start = 0, which is less than gas_k from route j->k

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
Single pass through the arrays

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)
Only using constant extra space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Check total: sum(gas) = 15, sum(cost) = 15 (feasible)

Start at index 0:
  i=0: current_gas = 0 + (1-3) = -2 (negative!)
  Reset start to 1, current_gas = 0

Start at index 1:
  i=1: current_gas = 0 + (2-4) = -2 (negative!)
  Reset start to 2, current_gas = 0

Start at index 2:
  i=2: current_gas = 0 + (3-5) = -2 (negative!)
  Reset start to 3, current_gas = 0

Start at index 3:
  i=3: current_gas = 0 + (4-1) = 3 ‚úì
  i=4: current_gas = 3 + (5-2) = 6 ‚úì

All positions checked, total_gas >= 0
Output: 3
```

### EDGE CASES:
- Single station: Only possible if gas[0] >= cost[0]
- All gas equals all cost: First station with gas[i] >= cost[i] works
- Multiple resets: The algorithm handles multiple candidate starting points
- Impossible cases: Return -1 when total gas < total cost

### ALTERNATIVE APPROACH (BRUTE FORCE):
Try each station as starting point and simulate full circuit.
Time: O(n¬≤), Space: O(1)
