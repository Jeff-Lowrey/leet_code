I'll help you implement the Gas Station problem solution in Python. This solution will determine if it's possible to complete a circular route starting from any gas station, given arrays of gas available and costs to travel.

Gas Station Implementation

Problem: Given two arrays representing gas available at stations and cost to travel
to next station, determine if there exists a starting gas station index from which
you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

This implementation includes:

1. A `Solution` class with the main implementation method `canCompleteCircuit`
2. Comprehensive documentation and comments
3. Type hints for better code readability
4. A test suite to verify the implementation
5. Proper error handling and edge cases
6. Example usage in the main block

The solution uses a greedy approach with the following logic:
- If total gas is less than total cost, no solution exists
- Keep track of current gas tank level while traversing stations
- If tank becomes negative, try starting from next station
- The first station that allows completing the circuit is the answer

The implementation handles various edge cases:
- Empty input arrays
- Single station
- No valid solution exists
- Multiple possible solutions (returns first valid one)

The code follows Python best practices and PEP 8 style guidelines.
