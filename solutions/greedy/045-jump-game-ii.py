# 045. Jump Game Ii

You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].

Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where 0 <= j <= nums[i] and i + j < n.

Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[2,3,1,1,4]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>2 (minimum jumps)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Minimum 2 jumps needed to reach end of [2,3,1,1,4]</dd>
</dl>

### INTUITION:
Track current reach and farthest reach. When reach exhausted, must jump (increment jumps) and update reach to farthest. Greedy: always extend reach as far as possible before jumping.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize variables**: Set jumps = 0, current_end = 0, farthest = 0
2. **Iterate to second-last**: For i in range(len(nums) - 1)
3. **Update farthest**: farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i])
4. **Reached current end**: If i == current_end, increment jumps
5. **Extend range**: Set current_end = farthest
6. **Continue jumping**: Process all positions
7. **Return result**: Return jumps as minimum number of jumps

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- BFS-like greedy: track current jump's reach and next jump's reach
- Increment jumps when reaching end of current jump's range
- Update next reach as maximum of (i + nums[i]) for all i in current range
- Guaranteed to reach end, so count minimum jumps needed
- O(n) time: single pass, O(1) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Step 1: Initialize variables
  jumps = 0, current_end = 0, farthest = 0

Step 2: Iterate through array
  i=0: farthest = max(0, 0+2) = 2
  i=1: farthest = max(2, 1+3) = 4, reached current_end ‚Üí jumps=1, current_end=2
  i=2: farthest = max(4, 2+1) = 4, reached current_end ‚Üí jumps=2, current_end=4

  Reached last index

Output: 2 (minimum jumps)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
