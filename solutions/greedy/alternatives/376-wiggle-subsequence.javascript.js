I'll help you implement the Wiggle Subsequence solution in JavaScript. Here's the complete implementation:

```javascript
/**
 * Wiggle Subsequence
 * 
 * A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers
 * strictly alternate between positive and negative.
 * 
 * @param {number[]} nums - Array of numbers
 * @return {number} - Length of the longest wiggle subsequence
 */
function wiggleMaxLength(nums) {
    // Handle edge cases
    if (nums.length < 2) {
        return nums.length;
    }

    // Initialize variables to track the lengths of sequences
    // up[i] represents the length of wiggle subsequence ending at index i with an up movement
    // down[i] represents the length of wiggle subsequence ending at index i with a down movement
    let up = 1;
    let down = 1;

    // Iterate through the array starting from index 1
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
            // Current number is greater than previous - up movement
            // We can extend a down sequence with an up movement
            up = down + 1;
        } else if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
            // Current number is less than previous - down movement
            // We can extend an up sequence with a down movement
            down = up + 1;
        }
        // If numbers are equal, we can't extend either sequence
    }

    // Return the maximum of up and down sequences
    return Math.max(up, down);
}

/**
 * Test cases
 */
function runTests() {
    const testCases = [
        {
            input: [1,7,4,9,2,5],
            expected: 6,
            description: "Regular wiggle sequence"
        },
        {
            input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8],
            expected: 7,
            description: "Longer sequence with multiple possibilities"
        },
        {
            input: [1,2,3,4,5],
            expected: 2,
            description: "Monotonically increasing sequence"
        },
        {
            input: [1],
            expected: 1,
            description: "Single element"
        },
        {
            input: [],
            expected: 0,
            description: "Empty array"
        }
    ];

    testCases.forEach((testCase, index) => {
        const result = wiggleMaxLength(testCase.input);
        console.log(`Test ${index + 1} (${testCase.description}):`);
        console.log(`Input: [${testCase.input}]`);
        console.log(`Expected: ${testCase.expected}`);
        console.log(`Result: ${result}`);
        console.log(`Status: ${result === testCase.expected ? 'PASSED' : 'FAILED'}`);
        console.log('---');
    });
}

// Export the function for use in other modules
module.exports = {
    wiggleMaxLength
};

// Run tests if this file is being run directly
if (require.main === module) {
    runTests();
}
```

This implementation includes:

1. A main `wiggleMaxLength` function that solves the Wiggle Subsequence problem using dynamic programming approach
2. Comprehensive comments explaining the logic and approach
3. Test cases covering various scenarios
4. Proper error handling for edge cases
5. Module exports for use in other files
6. A test runner that executes when the file is run directly

The solution uses an efficient approach with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. It tracks two variables:
- `up`: length of sequence ending with an up movement
- `down`: length of sequence ending with a down movement

The algorithm iterates through the array once, updating these variables based on the relationship between consecutive numbers.

To use this code:
1. Save it to the specified path
2. Run it directly to see test results: `node GD-376-JS_wiggle_subsequence___javascript_implementation.js`
3. Import it into other files using require: `const { wiggleMaxLength } = require('./path/to/file')`

The implementation follows JavaScript best practices and includes proper error handling, making it suitable for production use.
