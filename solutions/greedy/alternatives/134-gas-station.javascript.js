I'll help you implement the Gas Station problem in JavaScript. Here's a complete solution with comments and proper structure:

```javascript
/**
 * Gas Station Problem
 * 
 * Given two arrays: gas and cost, where:
 * - gas[i] represents the amount of gas available at station i
 * - cost[i] represents the cost to travel from station i to station i+1
 * 
 * Find the starting gas station's index from where you can travel around 
 * the circuit once in the clockwise direction. Return -1 if impossible.
 * 
 * @param {number[]} gas - Array of gas available at each station
 * @param {number[]} cost - Array of cost to travel to next station
 * @return {number} - Starting index or -1 if impossible
 */
function canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost) {
    // Input validation
    if (!gas || !cost || gas.length !== cost.length || gas.length === 0) {
        return -1;
    }

    // Initialize variables
    let totalSurplus = 0;    // Track overall gas surplus
    let currentSurplus = 0;  // Track current journey's gas surplus
    let startStation = 0;    // Potential starting station

    for (let i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
        // Calculate current gas surplus/deficit
        const currentDiff = gas[i] - cost[i];
        
        // Update total surplus
        totalSurplus += currentDiff;
        // Update current journey surplus
        currentSurplus += currentDiff;

        // If we can't reach next station
        if (currentSurplus < 0) {
            // Reset start to next station
            startStation = i + 1;
            // Reset current surplus
            currentSurplus = 0;
        }
    }

    // If total surplus is negative, circuit cannot be completed
    return totalSurplus >= 0 ? startStation : -1;
}

/**
 * Test cases
 */
function runTests() {
    // Test Case 1: Valid circuit
    console.log('Test 1:', canCompleteCircuit([1,2,3,4,5], [3,4,5,1,2]));  // Expected: 3

    // Test Case 2: Impossible circuit
    console.log('Test 2:', canCompleteCircuit([2,3,4], [3,4,3]));  // Expected: -1

    // Test Case 3: Single station
    console.log('Test 3:', canCompleteCircuit([1], [1]));  // Expected: 0

    // Test Case 4: Empty input
    console.log('Test 4:', canCompleteCircuit([], []));  // Expected: -1

    // Test Case 5: Exact amount needed
    console.log('Test 5:', canCompleteCircuit([2,3,4], [2,3,4]));  // Expected: 0
}

// Export for use in other modules
module.exports = {
    canCompleteCircuit
};

// Run tests if this file is being run directly
if (require.main === module) {
    runTests();
}
```

This implementation includes:

1. A well-documented main function `canCompleteCircuit` that solves the Gas Station problem
2. Input validation to handle edge cases
3. Efficient O(n) time complexity solution
4. Test cases to verify the implementation
5. Proper module exports for use in other files
6. Clear comments explaining the logic and approach

The solution uses a single pass through the array and keeps track of both the total surplus and current journey surplus. The key insights are:

- If the total surplus is negative, it's impossible to complete the circuit
- If we can't reach the next station from current position, we need to start from the next station
- We only need to traverse the array once to find the solution

The code handles various edge cases including:
- Empty input arrays
- Single station
- Impossible circuits
- Exact amount needed
- Valid circuits with different starting positions

The test cases demonstrate these different scenarios and help verify the implementation works correctly.
