I'll help you create a solution for the Partition Labels problem. This implementation will partition a string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.

Partition Labels - Python Implementation

This module provides a solution to partition a string into as many parts as possible
such that each letter appears in at most one part.

Example:
    Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
    Output: [9,7,8]
    Explanation:
    The partitions are "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".

This implementation includes:

1. A clear class-based solution with proper documentation
2. Type hints for better code readability and IDE support
3. Efficient implementation with O(n) time complexity
4. Comprehensive test cases
5. Clear comments explaining the logic
6. Proper error handling for edge cases
7. A test function to verify the implementation

The algorithm works by:
1. First finding the last occurrence of each character in the string
2. Then iterating through the string to find valid partitions
3. For each character, updating the end of current partition based on the last occurrence
4. When we reach the end of a partition, we add its length to the result

The solution handles various cases including:
- Empty strings
- Strings with all unique characters
- Strings with repeated characters
- Single-character strings
- Strings where all characters need to be in one partition

You can save this code to the specified path and run it directly to verify the implementation works correctly.
