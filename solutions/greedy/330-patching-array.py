# 330. Patching Array
# Difficulty: Hard
You are given a sorted positive integer array nums and an integer n. You need to
make it so that any integer in the range [1, n] can be formed by the sum of some
elements from nums.

Return the minimum number of patches (additions to the array) required.

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
The key insight is tracking what range [1, covered] we can currently form. If we
can form [1, covered], and we have a number x where x <= covered + 1, then adding
x extends our range to [1, covered + x]. If x > covered + 1, we have a gap and
need to patch with (covered + 1).

### APPROACH:
1. **Track coverage**: Maintain the maximum number we can currently build
2. **Use available numbers**: If nums[i] <= covered + 1, use it to extend coverage
3. **Patch when needed**: If nums[i] > covered + 1, patch with (covered + 1)
4. **Greedy choice**: Always patch with (covered + 1) as it doubles our coverage

### WHY GREEDY WORKS:
- **Optimal patching**: Patching with (covered + 1) is always optimal because:
  - We can already form [1, covered]
  - Adding (covered + 1) extends range to [1, 2*covered + 1]
  - No other patch value gives better extension
- **No backtracking needed**: Each decision is locally and globally optimal

### PROOF OF GREEDY CHOICE:
If we can form [1, covered], adding value v:
- If v = covered + 1: New range is [1, 2*covered + 1]
- If v > covered + 1: New range is [1, covered] ‚à™ [v, covered + v] (has gap)
- If v < covered + 1: New range is [1, covered + v] (less than optimal)
Therefore, v = covered + 1 is optimal for patching.

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(m + log n)
Where m is length of nums. In worst case, we need log(n) patches.

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)
Only using constant extra space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: nums = [1,3], n = 6

covered = 0, patches = 0

Step 1: 1 <= 0+1? Yes ‚Üí covered = 0+1 = 1
        Can now form: [1,1]

Step 2: 3 <= 1+1? No (3 > 2) ‚Üí Need patch!
        Patch with 2, patches = 1
        covered = 1 + 2 = 3
        Can now form: [1,3]

Step 3: 3 <= 3+1? Yes ‚Üí covered = 3+3 = 6
        Can now form: [1,6]

Step 4: covered >= 6, done!

Output: 1 (patched with 2)
```

### DETAILED EXAMPLE:
```
Input: nums = [1,5,10], n = 20

Initial: covered = 0, patches = 0

i=0: 1 <= 0+1? Yes ‚Üí covered = 0+1 = 1, can form [1,1]
i=1: 5 <= 1+1? No ‚Üí patch with 2, patches=1, covered = 1+2 = 3
     5 <= 3+1? No ‚Üí patch with 4, patches=2, covered = 3+4 = 7
     5 <= 7+1? Yes ‚Üí covered = 7+5 = 12, can form [1,12]
i=2: 10 <= 12+1? Yes ‚Üí covered = 12+10 = 22 >= 20, done!

Output: 2 (patched with 2 and 4)
```

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty array: Need to patch from 1 up to n
- Array already covers [1,n]: No patches needed
- Large n with small array: Multiple patches required
- Array starts with value > 1: Need to patch 1 first

### KEY INSIGHTS:
- Coverage doubling: Adding (covered + 1) doubles the range
- Greedy is optimal: No need to consider other patch values
- Use before patch: Always try to use existing numbers first
