I'll help you implement a solution for the Patching Array problem in Python. Here's a complete implementation with comments and proper structure:

Patching Array - Python Implementation

This module provides a solution to find the minimum number of patches required
to make an array cover all numbers from 1 to n.

Given a sorted array nums and a target number n, we need to find the minimum
number of patches required so that we can build every number in the range [1, n]
using numbers from the array.

        Returns:
            int: Minimum number of patches needed

```

This implementation includes:

1. A complete solution to the Patching Array problem
2. Proper type hints and documentation
3. Clear comments explaining the logic
4. Test cases to verify the solution
5. Main execution block with example usage
6. Efficient algorithm with O(m + logn) time complexity

The algorithm works by:
1. Maintaining a 'covered' range that represents numbers we can currently build
2. Either using numbers from the input array or adding patches as needed
3. When adding a patch, we add the smallest number we can't currently build
4. Continuing until we can build all numbers up to n

The solution handles edge cases such as:
- Empty input array
- Already complete sequences
- Large target numbers
- Various array sizes and configurations

The code follows Python best practices and conventions, including:
- Clear variable names
- Type hints
- Docstrings
- Proper indentation
- Modular structure
- Test cases

You can save this code to the specified path and run it directly to see the test cases in action.
