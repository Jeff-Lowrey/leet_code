I'll help you implement a solution for the Wiggle Subsequence problem. Here's a clean and well-documented implementation:

Wiggle Subsequence Implementation

This module provides a solution for finding the length of the longest wiggle subsequence.
A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers
strictly alternate between positive and negative.

Example:
    Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5]
    Output: 6 (The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence)

        Find the length of the longest wiggle subsequence.
        
        A sequence [x1, x2, ..., xn] is a wiggle sequence if its differences
        (x2-x1), (x3-x2), ..., (xn-x[n-1]) strictly alternate between positive and negative.

This implementation includes:

1. A complete solution using dynamic programming approach
2. Proper documentation with docstrings
3. Type hints for better code readability
4. A main function with test cases
5. Proper handling of edge cases
6. Clear comments explaining the logic
7. Following Python PEP 8 style guidelines

The solution uses two dynamic programming arrays to keep track of the longest wiggle subsequence that ends with either an up or down movement. The final result is the maximum of these two arrays at the last position.

The code handles various edge cases:
- Empty input array
- Single element array
- Arrays with duplicate elements
- Arrays with strictly increasing/decreasing elements

You can run this file directly to see the results of the test cases, or import the Solution class to use it in other parts of your project.
