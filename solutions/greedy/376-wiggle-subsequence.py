# 376. Wiggle Subsequence

A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[1,7,4,9,2,5]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>6 (longest wiggle sequence length)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Longest wiggle subsequence in [1,7,4,9,2,5] has length 6</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
A wiggle occurs when direction changes (up->down or down->up). Greedily count direction changes by tracking previous difference sign. Skip equal consecutive numbers.

### APPROACH:
1. **Handle edge cases**: If len(nums) < 2, return len(nums)
2. **Initialize variables**: Set up = 1, down = 1
3. **Iterate from second element**: For i in range(1, len(nums))
4. **Check increasing**: If nums[i] > nums[i-1], up = down + 1
5. **Check decreasing**: If nums[i] < nums[i-1], down = up + 1
6. **Continue processing**: Update up and down for each element
7. **Return result**: Return max(up, down)

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Track up/down lengths: up[i] = longest wiggle ending with up, down[i] ending with down
- If nums[i] > nums[i-1]: up = down + 1 (extend down sequence with up)
- If nums[i] < nums[i-1]: down = up + 1 (extend up sequence with down)
- Greedy works: always extend appropriate sequence
- O(n) time, O(1) space with two variables

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Step 1: Track direction changes
  up = 1, down = 1

Step 2: Process each adjacent pair
  1‚Üí7: increasing, up = down + 1 = 2
  7‚Üí4: decreasing, down = up + 1 = 3
  4‚Üí9: increasing, up = down + 1 = 4
  9‚Üí2: decreasing, down = up + 1 = 5
  2‚Üí5: increasing, up = down + 1 = 6

Output: 6 (longest wiggle sequence length)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
