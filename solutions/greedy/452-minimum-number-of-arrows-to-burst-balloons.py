I'll help you implement a solution for the Burst Balloons problem. This solution will use dynamic programming to find the maximum coins that can be obtained by bursting balloons optimally.

Burst Balloons - Python Implementation

Problem: Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a
number on it represented by array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons.
If you burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] coins.
Here left and right are adjacent indices of i. After the burst, the left and right
then becomes adjacent.

Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

Example:
    Input: nums = [3,1,5,8]
    Output: 167
    Explanation:
    nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] --> [3,8] --> [8] --> []
    coins =  3*1*5    +  3*5*8    +  1*3*8  + 1*8*1  = 167

This implementation includes:

1. A dynamic programming solution (`maxCoins`) that uses a bottom-up approach
2. An alternative recursive solution with memoization (`maxCoins_recursive`)
3. Comprehensive documentation and comments
4. Test cases to verify the implementation
5. Proper type hints and error handling
6. Clean code structure following Python conventions

The main solution uses a dynamic programming approach where:
- We add padding of 1's at the start and end of the array
- Use a 2D DP table to store intermediate results
- Calculate the maximum coins for increasingly larger windows
- Consider each balloon as the last one to burst in each window

The recursive solution provides an alternative approach using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Both solutions handle edge cases appropriately and provide the same optimal result. The code includes test cases to verify the implementation works correctly.
