# Difficulty: Hard

# 135. Candy

There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given
in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to
the children.

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
This is a classic greedy problem requiring two passes. The key insight is that we
need to satisfy both left and right neighbor constraints independently, then take
the maximum to satisfy both.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize**: Give each child 1 candy initially
2. **Left to right pass**: If ratings[i] > ratings[i-1], ensure candies[i] > candies[i-1]
3. **Right to left pass**: If ratings[i] > ratings[i+1], ensure candies[i] > candies[i+1]
4. **Sum total**: Return sum of all candies

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- **Greedy choice**: We assign minimum necessary candies to satisfy local constraints
- **Two passes ensure both directions**:
  - Left pass ensures right neighbor constraint
  - Right pass ensures left neighbor constraint
  - Taking max ensures both constraints satisfied
- **Optimality**: Each assignment is minimal, so total is minimal

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]

Initial: candies = [1,1,1]

Left to right pass:
  i=1: ratings[1]=0 < ratings[0]=1, no change
       candies = [1,1,1]
  i=2: ratings[2]=2 > ratings[1]=0, candies[2] = candies[1] + 1 = 2
       candies = [1,1,2]

Right to left pass:
  i=1: ratings[1]=0 < ratings[2]=2, no change
       candies = [1,1,2]
  i=0: ratings[0]=1 > ratings[1]=0, candies[0] = max(1, 1+1) = 2
       candies = [2,1,2]

Total: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)
Two passes through the array

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(n)
Array to store candy counts (can be optimized to O(1) with complex logic)

### EDGE CASES:
- Single child: Return 1
- All same rating: Each gets 1 candy
- Strictly increasing: [1,2,3,...,n]
- Strictly decreasing: [n,n-1,...,2,1]
- Valley pattern: [2,1,2] ‚Üí [2,1,2]
- Peak pattern: [1,2,1] ‚Üí [1,2,1]
