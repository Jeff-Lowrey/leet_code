I'll help you implement the Candy problem solution in Python. This solution will handle the distribution of candies to children based on their ratings, ensuring each child gets at least one candy and children with higher ratings get more candies than their neighbors.

This implementation includes:

1. Two different approaches to solve the candy distribution problem:
   - `candy`: A straightforward two-pass solution using an array
   - `candy_optimized`: A more space-efficient single-pass solution

2. Comprehensive documentation including:
   - Problem description
   - Time and space complexity analysis
   - Detailed comments explaining the logic
   - Type hints for better code readability

3. A test function to verify the implementation with various test cases

4. Proper error handling and edge cases:
   - Empty input arrays
   - Single-element arrays
   - Arrays with equal ratings
   - Arrays with increasing/decreasing sequences

5. Python best practices:
   - Type hints
   - Docstrings
   - Clear variable names
   - Proper code structure
   - PEP 8 compliance

The code handles the candy distribution problem efficiently and includes both a simple-to-understand solution and an optimized version. The test cases cover various scenarios to ensure the implementation works correctly.
