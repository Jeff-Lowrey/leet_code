This implementation provides two approaches to solve the Alien Dictionary problem:

1. DFS-based topological sorting
2. BFS-based topological sorting (Kahn's algorithm)

Key features of the implementation:

1. Handles edge cases (empty input, invalid ordering)
2. Detects cycles in the character ordering
3. Builds a graph representation using adjacency lists
4. Provides detailed comments explaining the logic
5. Includes example usage and test cases
6. Uses type hints for better code readability
7. Follows Python naming conventions and best practices

The solution efficiently determines the order of characters in the alien alphabet based on the given sorted words. It returns an empty string if no valid ordering exists (due to contradictions or cycles).

The code can be saved to the specified path and run directly to see the results of the test cases.
