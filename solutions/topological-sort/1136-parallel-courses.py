# 1136. Parallel Courses

You are given an integer n, which indicates that there are n courses labeled from 1 to n. You are also given an array relations where relations[i] = [prevCoursei, nextCoursei], representing a prerequisite relationship between course prevCoursei and course nextCoursei: course prevCoursei has to be taken before course nextCoursei.

In one semester, you can take any number of courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites in the previous semester for the courses you are taking.

Return the minimum number of semesters needed to take all courses. If there is no way to take all the courses, return -1.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>2 (minimum semesters)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Minimum semesters to complete all courses</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Build graph and calculate in-degrees. Use BFS starting from nodes with in-degree 0. Process courses level by level (semester by semester). Track maximum semester count needed.

### APPROACH:
1. **Build graph and indegrees**: Create adjacency list and indegree array
2. **Initialize queue**: Add all courses with indegree 0 to queue
3. **Initialize semester**: Set semester = 0
4. **Process by level**: While queue not empty, process all courses at current level
5. **Increment semester**: semester += 1 for each level
6. **Update neighbors**: For each neighbor, decrement indegree, add to queue if 0
7. **Check completion**: If processed < n courses, cycle exists, return -1
8. **Return result**: Return semester

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Topological sort with BFS, track depth (semester number)
- All courses at same level can be taken in parallel (same semester)
- Increment semester when level completes
- If can't complete all courses, return -1 (cycle)
- O(V + E) time, O(V + E) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Step 1: Build graph and indegree
  indegree = [0,0,2]

Step 2: Process courses level by level
  Semester 1: courses 1,2 (indegree=0)
  Semester 2: course 3 (after 1,2 complete)

Output: 2 (minimum semesters)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
