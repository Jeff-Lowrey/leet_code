# Difficulty: Medium

# 802. Find

There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].

A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).

Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>[2,4,5,6] (safe nodes)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Safe nodes are those not in cycles: [2,4,5,6]</dd>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Build reverse graph (who reaches who). Use Kahn's algorithm. Nodes with out-degree 0 are safe (reach terminal). Process in reverse topological order to find all safe nodes.

### APPROACH:
1. **Build graph**: Create adjacency list from graph edges
2. **Track colors**: Use colors array: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited
3. **Define DFS**: Implement dfs(node) to detect cycles
4. **Check visiting**: If colors[node] == 1, cycle detected, return False
5. **Check visited**: If colors[node] == 2, already safe, return True
6. **Mark visiting**: Set colors[node] = 1, explore all neighbors
7. **Mark visited**: If all neighbors safe, set colors[node] = 2
8. **Find safe nodes**: Return nodes where dfs(node) returns True

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Reverse graph, find nodes from which all paths lead to terminals
- Color nodes: 0=unvisited, 1=visiting, 2=safe
- DFS: if all neighbors are safe, current node is safe
- If reaches cycle (visiting node), not safe
- O(V + E) time: DFS visits each node/edge once, O(V) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Step 1: Find nodes with cycles
  0‚Üí1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí0 (cycle)

Step 2: Find terminal nodes
  Nodes: 5,6

Step 3: Check which nodes reach only terminal
  Check each node's reachability

Output: [2,4,5,6] (safe nodes)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
