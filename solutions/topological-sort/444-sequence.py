Sequence Reconstruction Implementation

This module provides a solution for determining if a sequence can be uniquely reconstructed
from its subsequences.

Time Complexity: O(n + m) where n is the length of org and m is total length of seqs
Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of org

This implementation provides a solution for the Sequence Reconstruction problem with the following features:

1. **Clean Structure**: The code is well-organized with clear function definitions and documentation.

2. **Type Hints**: Uses Python type hints for better code readability and IDE support.

3. **Documentation**: Includes detailed docstrings explaining the purpose and usage of functions.

4. **Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Uses a graph-based approach with topological sorting
   - Implements efficient checking for unique reconstruction
   - Handles edge cases appropriately

5. **Test Cases**: Includes a test function with various test cases to verify the implementation.

6. **Best Practices**:
   - Follows PEP 8 style guidelines
   - Uses appropriate data structures (defaultdict, deque)
   - Includes proper error handling

The solution uses a topological sorting approach to determine if the original sequence can be uniquely reconstructed from the given subsequences. It builds a directed graph from the subsequences and checks if there's exactly one possible topological ordering that matches the original sequence.

The implementation is efficient with O(n + m) time complexity, where n is the length of the original sequence and m is the total length of all subsequences.
