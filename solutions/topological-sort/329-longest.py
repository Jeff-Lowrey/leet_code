# Difficulty: Medium

# 329. Longest

Given an m x n integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in matrix.

From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>4 (longest increasing path)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Longest increasing path in matrix is 4</dd>
</dl>

### INTUITION:
Build graph of dependencies. Start DFS from each cell. Use memoization to store longest path from each cell. Result is max of all starting points. DFS explores increasing values only.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize memoization**: Create memo = {} to cache results
2. **Define DFS function**: Implement dfs(i, j) to find longest path from cell (i,j)
3. **Check memo**: If (i,j) in memo, return memo[(i,j)]
4. **Explore neighbors**: For each of 4 directions, check if can move (increasing value)
5. **Recursive call**: If valid, max_path = max(max_path, 1 + dfs(ni, nj))
6. **Memoize result**: memo[(i,j)] = max_path
7. **Try all cells**: For each cell, call dfs and track maximum
8. **Return result**: Return global maximum path length

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- DFS with memoization: longest path from each cell
- Only move to adjacent cells with greater values (DAG ensures no cycles)
- Memo[i][j] caches longest path starting at (i,j)
- Try all 4 directions, take max + 1
- O(m*n) time: each cell computed once, O(m*n) space for memo

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]
Step 1: DFS with memoization
  Start from 9: can go to 6 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 1, length=4

Step 2: Try all cells
  Best path: 9‚Üí6‚Üí2‚Üí1

Output: 4 (longest increasing path)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
