I'll help you implement a solution for the Longest Increasing Path problem in Python. This solution will use DFS with memoization to find the longest increasing path in a matrix.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def longestIncreasingPath(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        """
        Find the longest increasing path in a matrix where you can move in four directions
        (up, down, left, right).
        
        Args:
            matrix: 2D list of integers representing the matrix
            
        Returns:
            int: Length of the longest increasing path
        """
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
            return 0
        
        rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        # Cache to store computed results for each cell
        memo = {}
        
        def dfs(row: int, col: int, prev_val: int) -> int:
            """

                col: Current column position

            """
            # Check boundaries and if current value is less than previous
            if (row < 0 or row >= rows or 
                col < 0 or col >= cols or 
                matrix[row][col] <= prev_val):
                return 0
            
            # If result is cached, return it
            if (row, col) in memo:
                return memo[(row, col)]
            
            current = matrix[row][col]
            
            # Explore all four directions
            up = dfs(row - 1, col, current)
            down = dfs(row + 1, col, current)
            left = dfs(row, col - 1, current)
            right = dfs(row, col + 1, current)
            
            # Store the maximum path length starting from current cell
            memo[(row, col)] = 1 + max(up, down, left, right)
            return memo[(row, col)]
        
        # Try starting from each cell and find the maximum path length
        max_path = 0
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                max_path = max(max_path, dfs(i, j, float('-inf')))
        
        return max_path


def test_longest_increasing_path():

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_longest_increasing_path()
```

This implementation includes:

1. A `Solution` class with the main `longestIncreasingPath` method
2. A DFS helper function with memoization to avoid redundant calculations
3. Comprehensive handling of edge cases (empty matrix, single element matrix)
4. Test cases to verify the implementation
5. Clear comments explaining the logic and functionality
6. Type hints for better code readability and maintainability

The algorithm works by:
1. Using DFS to explore all possible paths from each cell
2. Memoizing results to avoid recalculating paths
3. Checking all four directions (up, down, left, right) for each cell
4. Maintaining a cache of computed results for efficiency
5. Returning the maximum path length found

The time complexity is O(m*n) where m and n are the dimensions of the matrix, and space complexity is O(m*n) for the memoization cache.

The code follows Python best practices and includes proper error handling and edge cases. It can be run directly to test the implementation with the included test cases.
