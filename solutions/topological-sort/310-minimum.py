I'll help you implement a solution for finding Minimum Height Trees in Python. I'll create a clean, well-documented solution that handles the requirements efficiently.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Solution:
    def findMinHeightTrees(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        """
        Find the root nodes of all possible minimum height trees (MHTs).
        
        Args:
            n: Number of nodes (0 to n-1)
            edges: List of undirected edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi]
            
        Returns:
            List of root nodes that can form minimum height trees
        
        Time Complexity: O(n)
        Space Complexity: O(n)
        """
        # Handle edge cases
        if n <= 2:
            return list(range(n))
            
        # Build adjacency list representation of the graph
        adj_list = defaultdict(set)
        for u, v in edges:
            adj_list[u].add(v)
            adj_list[v].add(u)
            
        # Start with leaves (nodes with only one neighbor)
        leaves = [node for node in range(n) if len(adj_list[node]) == 1]
        
        # Keep removing leaves until we reach the center(s)
        remaining_nodes = n
        while remaining_nodes > 2:
            remaining_nodes -= len(leaves)
            new_leaves = []
            
            # Process current leaves
            for leaf in leaves:
                # Get the neighbor of current leaf
                neighbor = adj_list[leaf].pop()
                # Remove the leaf from neighbor's adjacency list
                adj_list[neighbor].remove(leaf)
                
                # If neighbor becomes a leaf, add it to new leaves
                if len(adj_list[neighbor]) == 1:
                    new_leaves.append(neighbor)
            
            leaves = new_leaves
            
        return leaves

def test_solution():
    """
    Test cases to verify the implementation
    """
    solution = Solution()
    
    # Test case 1: Simple tree
    assert solution.findMinHeightTrees(4, [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]) == [1]
    
    # Test case 2: Line graph
    assert sorted(solution.findMinHeightTrees(4, [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]])) == [1,2]
    
    # Test case 3: Single node
    assert solution.findMinHeightTrees(1, []) == [0]
    
    # Test case 4: Two nodes
    assert sorted(solution.findMinHeightTrees(2, [[0,1]])) == [0,1]
    
    print("All test cases passed!")

```

This implementation provides a solution to find the root nodes of all possible minimum height trees. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. The `findMinHeightTrees` method implements the core logic:
   - It uses a "leaf removal" approach, where we iteratively remove leaf nodes until we reach the center(s)
   - The center nodes will form the roots of minimum height trees

2. Key features of the implementation:
   - Uses adjacency list representation for the graph
   - Handles edge cases (n â‰¤ 2)
   - Efficiently processes leaves in layers
   - Returns multiple centers when applicable

3. The solution includes:
   - Type hints for better code clarity
   - Comprehensive comments explaining the logic
   - Time and space complexity annotations
   - Test cases to verify functionality

4. The algorithm works by:
   - Building an adjacency list representation
   - Identifying initial leaves
   - Iteratively removing leaves until reaching the center(s)
   - Returning the remaining nodes as potential roots

5. Test cases cover various scenarios:
   - Simple tree structure
   - Line graph
   - Single node
   - Two nodes

The implementation follows Python best practices and provides an efficient solution with O(n) time complexity.
