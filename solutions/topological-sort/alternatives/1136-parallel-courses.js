/**
 * # Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * # 1136. Parallel Courses
 *
 * You are given an integer n, which indicates that there are n courses labeled from 1 to n. You are also given an array relations where relations[i] = [prevCoursei, nextCoursei], representing a prerequisite relationship between course prevCoursei and course nextCoursei: course prevCoursei has to be taken before course nextCoursei.
 *
 * In one semester, you can take any number of courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites in the previous semester for the courses you are taking.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of semesters needed to take all courses. If there is no way to take all the courses, return -1.
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]]</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>2 (minimum semesters)</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>Minimum semesters to complete all courses</dd>
 * </dl>

 * <summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>
 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * [This problem requires understanding of topological sort concepts. The key insight is to identify the optimal approach for this specific scenario.]
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Analyze the problem**: Understand the input constraints and expected output
 * 2. **Choose the right technique**: Apply topological sort methodology
 * 3. **Implement efficiently**: Focus on optimal time and space complexity
 * 4. **Handle edge cases**: Consider boundary conditions and special cases
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * - The solution leverages topological sort principles
 * - Time complexity is optimized for the given constraints
 * - Space complexity is minimized where possible
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
 * Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]]
 * Step 1: Build graph and indegree
 *   indegree = [0,0,2]
 *
 * Step 2: Process courses level by level
 *   Semester 1: courses 1,2 (indegree=0)
 *   Semester 2: course 3 (after 1,2 complete)
 *
 * Output: 2 (minimum semesters)
 * ```
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(n)
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(1)
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - Empty input handling
 * - Single element cases
 * - Large input considerations
