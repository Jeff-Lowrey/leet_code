/**
 * # Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to `numCourses - 1`.
 * You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates
 * that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
 *
 * Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: `numCourses = 2`, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should
 * have finished course 0. So it is possible.
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>numCourses = 2`, prerequisites = [[1,0]]</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>true</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>Course schedule [0,1] means 0 depends on 1; can finish if no cycles</dd>
 * </dl>

 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * This is a cycle detection problem in a directed graph. If there's a cycle in the prerequisite dependencies, it's impossible to complete all courses. Topological sorting can detect cycles while finding a valid course order.
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Build adjacency list**: Create a graph where each prerequisite points to the courses that depend on it
 * 2. **Calculate in-degrees**: Count incoming edges for each course (number of prerequisites)
 * 3. **Initialize queue**: Add all courses with in-degree 0 (no prerequisites) to the queue
 * 4. **Process courses**: Dequeue a course, increment courses_taken counter
 * 5. **Update dependencies**: For each course that depends on the current course, decrement its in-degree
 * 6. **Add newly available courses**: If a course's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue (all prerequisites met)
 * 7. **Check completion**: Return true if courses_taken equals numCourses (all courses processed), false otherwise (cycle detected)
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * In a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), there's always at least one vertex with in-degree 0. By repeatedly removing such vertices, we can process all vertices if and only if there's no cycle.
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * Prerequisites: [[1,0], [2,1], [3,2]]
 * 1. Build graph: 0‚Üí1‚Üí2‚Üí3
 * 2. In-degrees: [0,1,1,1]
 * 3. Start with course 0 (in-degree 0)
 * 4. Take 0 ‚Üí course 1 now has in-degree 0
 * 5. Take 1 ‚Üí course 2 now has in-degree 0
 * 6. Continue until all courses taken
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(V + E)
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(V + E)
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - **No prerequisites**: All courses can be taken, return true
 * - **Self-loop**: Course depends on itself, cycle detected, return false
 * - **Circular dependency**: Cycle detection returns false
 * - **Linear chain**: No cycles, courses taken in topological order
 * - **Disconnected components**: Process each component separately
