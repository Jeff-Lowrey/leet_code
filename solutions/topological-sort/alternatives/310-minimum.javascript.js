I'll help you create a solution for the Minimum Height Trees problem in JavaScript. I'll write a complete implementation with comments and proper error handling.

```javascript
/**
 * Find the roots of minimum height trees (MHT) in an undirected graph
 * @param {number} n - Number of nodes in the graph (labeled from 0 to n-1)
 * @param {number[][]} edges - Array of edges, where each edge is [node1, node2]
 * @return {number[]} - Array of root nodes that result in minimum height trees
 */
function findMinHeightTrees(n, edges) {
    // Handle edge cases
    if (n === 0) return [];
    if (n === 1) return [0];
    if (n === 2) return [0, 1];

    // Create adjacency list representation of the graph
    const adjList = new Array(n).fill(0).map(() => new Set());
    
    // Build the adjacency list from edges
    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        adjList[u].add(v);
        adjList[v].add(u);
    }

    // Start with leaves (nodes with only one neighbor)
    let leaves = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (adjList[i].size === 1) {
            leaves.push(i);
        }
    }

    // Keep removing leaves until we reach the center(s)
    let remainingNodes = n;
    while (remainingNodes > 2) {
        remainingNodes -= leaves.length;
        const newLeaves = [];

        // Process current leaves
        for (const leaf of leaves) {
            // Get the neighbor of current leaf
            const neighbor = Array.from(adjList[leaf])[0];
            // Remove the leaf from neighbor's adjacency list
            adjList[neighbor].delete(leaf);
            // If neighbor becomes a leaf, add it to new leaves
            if (adjList[neighbor].size === 1) {
                newLeaves.push(neighbor);
            }
        }

        // Update leaves for next iteration
        leaves = newLeaves;
    }

    return leaves;
}

/**
 * Helper function to test the implementation
 * @param {number} n - Number of nodes
 * @param {number[][]} edges - Array of edges
 */
function testMHT(n, edges) {
    console.log(`Input: n = ${n}, edges = ${JSON.stringify(edges)}`);
    const result = findMinHeightTrees(n, edges);
    console.log(`Output: ${JSON.stringify(result)}\n`);
}

// Test cases
function runTests() {
    // Test Case 1
    testMHT(4, [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]);
    
    // Test Case 2
    testMHT(6, [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]);
    
    // Test Case 3
    testMHT(1, []);
    
    // Test Case 4
    testMHT(2, [[0,1]]);
}

// Run the tests
runTests();

module.exports = {
    findMinHeightTrees
};
```

This implementation solves the Minimum Height Trees problem with the following features:

1. **Main Algorithm**: Uses a "leaf removal" approach where we iteratively remove leaf nodes until we reach the center(s) of the tree.

2. **Data Structures**:
   - Uses adjacency lists (implemented with Sets) for efficient graph representation
   - Maintains a list of current leaves for processing

3. **Key Features**:
   - Handles all edge cases (n = 0, 1, 2)
   - Efficient implementation with O(n) time complexity
   - Clear comments explaining the logic
   - Includes test cases for verification

4. **Helper Functions**:
   - `testMHT`: Helper function to run test cases
   - `runTests`: Function to execute multiple test cases

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Properly handles edge cases
   - Input validation for basic cases

The algorithm works by:
1. Creating an adjacency list representation of the graph
2. Finding initial leaf nodes (nodes with only one neighbor)
3. Iteratively removing leaves until only 1 or 2 nodes remain
4. Returning the remaining nodes as the roots of minimum height trees

The code is structured as a complete module with exports for potential reuse in other parts of the application.
