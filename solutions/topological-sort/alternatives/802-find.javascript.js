I'll help you create a solution for the "Find Eventual Safe States" problem. I'll write a complete JavaScript implementation with comments and proper structure.

```javascript
/**
 * Find Eventual Safe States
 * 
 * Problem: Given a directed graph, find all safe nodes.
 * A node is safe if all possible paths starting from that node lead to a terminal node.
 * A terminal node is a node with no outgoing edges.
 * 
 * @param {number[][]} graph - The input graph represented as an adjacency list
 * @return {number[]} - Array of safe nodes in ascending order
 */

/**
 * @param {number[][]} graph
 * @return {number[]}
 */
const eventualSafeNodes = function(graph) {
    // Create array to track node states
    // 0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: safe
    const state = new Array(graph.length).fill(0);
    const result = [];

    /**
     * DFS helper function to detect if a node is safe
     * @param {number} node - Current node being visited
     * @return {boolean} - Whether the node is safe
     */
    const isSafe = (node) => {
        // If node is being visited, we found a cycle
        if (state[node] === 1) return false;
        // If node has been fully visited, return its safety status
        if (state[node] === 2) return true;

        // Mark node as being visited
        state[node] = 1;

        // Check all neighbors
        for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
            // If any neighbor leads to an unsafe path, current node is unsafe
            if (!isSafe(neighbor)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        // Mark node as safe
        state[node] = 2;
        return true;
    };

    // Check each node in the graph
    for (let i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
        if (isSafe(i)) {
            result.push(i);
        }
    }

    return result;
};

// Example usage and test cases
function runTests() {
    const testCases = [
        // Test case 1: Simple graph with safe nodes
        [[1,2], [2,3], [5], [0], [5], [], []],
        
        // Test case 2: Graph with cycle
        [[1,2,3,4], [1,2], [3,4], [0,4], []],
        
        // Test case 3: Empty graph
        [],
        
        // Test case 4: Single node graph
        [[]]
    ];

    for (let i = 0; i < testCases.length; i++) {
        console.log(`Test case ${i + 1}:`);
        console.log('Input:', testCases[i]);
        console.log('Output:', eventualSafeNodes(testCases[i]));
        console.log('---');
    }
}

// Run tests if not in production
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
    runTests();
}

module.exports = eventualSafeNodes;
```

This implementation provides a solution to the "Find Eventual Safe States" problem with the following features:

1. **Main Function**: `eventualSafeNodes` takes a graph as input and returns an array of safe nodes.

2. **Helper Function**: `isSafe` uses DFS to determine if a node is safe by checking if all paths from that node lead to terminal nodes.

3. **State Tracking**: Uses a state array to track node status:
   - 0: unvisited
   - 1: currently being visited (used to detect cycles)
   - 2: confirmed safe

4. **Cycle Detection**: The implementation can detect cycles in the graph, which would make nodes unsafe.

5. **Test Cases**: Includes various test cases to verify the implementation works correctly.

6. **Error Handling**: Handles edge cases like empty graphs and single-node graphs.

7. **Documentation**: Includes detailed comments explaining the implementation and approach.

The solution efficiently handles the following cases:
- Graphs with cycles
- Graphs with terminal nodes
- Empty graphs
- Single-node graphs
- Complex graphs with multiple paths

The time complexity is O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. The space complexity is O(V) for the state array and recursion stack.

The code is structured as a complete module that can be both used directly and imported into other files. It includes test cases that run only when not in production mode.
