/**
 * # Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * # 851. Loud And Rich
 *
 * There is a group of n people labeled from 0 to n - 1 where each person has a different amount of money and a different level of quietness.
 *
 * You are given an array richer where richer[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that ai has more money than bi and an integer array quiet where quiet[i] is the quietness of the ith person. All the given data in richer are logically correct (i.e., the data will not lead you to a situation where x is richer than y and y is richer than x at the same time).
 *
 * Return an integer array answer where answer[x] = y if y is the least quiet person (that is, the person y with the smallest value of quiet[y]) among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than the person x.
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>richer = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,7],[4,3],[5,3],[6,3]], quiet = [3,2,5,4,6,1,7,0]</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>[5,5,2,5,4,5,6,7]</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>Person with most wealth has loudness calculated from dependencies</dd>

 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * [This problem requires understanding of topological sort concepts. The key insight is to identify the optimal approach for this specific scenario.]
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Analyze the problem**: Understand the input constraints and expected output
 * 2. **Choose the right technique**: Apply topological sort methodology
 * 3. **Implement efficiently**: Focus on optimal time and space complexity
 * 4. **Handle edge cases**: Consider boundary conditions and special cases
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * - The solution leverages topological sort principles
 * - Time complexity is optimized for the given constraints
 * - Space complexity is minimized where possible
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
 * Input: richer = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,7],[4,3],[5,3],[6,3]], quiet = [3,2,5,4,6,1,7,0]
 * Step 1: Build graph (richer relationships)
 *   0 ‚Üê 1 ‚Üê 2
 *   1 ‚Üê 3 ‚Üê 4,5,6
 *   7 ‚Üê 3
 *
 * Step 2: DFS to find quietest richer person
 *   For person 0: check all richer (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
 *   Find quietest among them
 *
 * Output: [5,5,2,5,4,5,6,7]
 * ```
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(n)
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(1)
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - Empty input handling
 * - Single element cases
 * - Large input considerations
