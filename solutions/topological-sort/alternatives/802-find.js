 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * The key insight for solving Find is to understand the core problem pattern
 * and apply the most efficient algorithmic approach.
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. Analyze the problem requirements
 * 2. Choose the optimal data structure
 * 3. Implement the solution step by step
 * 4. Handle edge cases appropriately
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * This approach works because it leverages the fundamental properties of the problem
 * to achieve an efficient solution.
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * For a typical input, the algorithm processes the data systematically
 * to produce the expected output.
