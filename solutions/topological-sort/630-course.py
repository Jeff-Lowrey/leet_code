I'll help you implement the Course Schedule III solution in Python. This will solve the problem of finding the maximum number of courses that can be taken given their durations and deadlines.

Course Schedule III - Python Implementation

Problem: Given an array of courses where courses[i] = [duration_i, lastDay_i],
return the maximum number of courses that you can take.

A course should be taken continuously. You must take the course before its deadline
and the course must be completed before taking another course.

This implementation includes:

1. A `Solution` class with the main `scheduleCourse` method that implements the course scheduling logic
2. A greedy approach using a max heap to keep track of taken courses
3. Comprehensive comments explaining the implementation
4. Test cases covering various scenarios
5. Proper type hints and docstrings
6. Main execution block with example usage

The algorithm works by:
1. Sorting courses by deadline
2. Processing each course in order
3. Taking courses when possible
4. Using a max heap to optimize by swapping longer duration courses with shorter ones when necessary

The solution handles edge cases such as:
- Empty course list
- Single course
- Impossible courses
- Courses with same deadline
- Various combinations of durations and deadlines

The implementation follows Python best practices and provides an efficient solution with O(n log n) time complexity.
