<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
[This problem requires understanding of topological sort concepts. The key insight is to identify the optimal approach for this specific scenario.]

### APPROACH:
1. **Analyze the problem**: Understand the input constraints and expected output
2. **Choose the right technique**: Apply topological sort methodology
3. **Implement efficiently**: Focus on optimal time and space complexity
4. **Handle edge cases**: Consider boundary conditions and special cases

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- The solution leverages topological sort principles
- Time complexity is optimized for the given constraints
- Space complexity is minimized where possible

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: [example input]
Step 1: [explain first step]
Step 2: [explain second step]
Output: [expected output]
```

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
