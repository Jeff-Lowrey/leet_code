This implementation includes:

1. A `Solution` class with the `trap` method that implements the monotonic stack approach
2. Comprehensive comments explaining the logic and steps
3. Type hints for better code readability and IDE support
4. A test function with multiple test cases to verify the implementation
5. Main block with example usage
6. Proper error handling and edge cases

The solution uses a monotonic stack approach to calculate trapped water:
- It maintains a stack of indices where the heights are in decreasing order
- When it finds a bar higher than the top of the stack, it calculates the trapped water
- The calculation considers the distance between bars and the bounded height
- The process continues until all bars are processed

The implementation handles various edge cases:
- Empty input array
- Single element array
- Array with no trapped water
- Array with various height patterns

The code follows Python best practices and PEP 8 style guidelines, making it clean and maintainable.
