I'll help you implement a solution for the 132 Pattern problem in Python. This solution will check if a sequence contains a "132 pattern" where we need to find three numbers in the sequence such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j].

132 Pattern Implementation

This module provides a solution to find if an array contains a 132 pattern.
A 132 pattern consists of three numbers nums[i], nums[j], and nums[k] where:
- i < j < k
- nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j]

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

This implementation includes:

1. A `Solution` class with the main `find132pattern` method that implements the logic to find a 132 pattern in the given array.

2. The algorithm uses a stack-based approach to efficiently find the pattern:
   - It maintains a stack of potential "3" values
   - Keeps track of the maximum "2" value seen so far
   - Iterates through the array from right to left

3. Time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input array, as we process each element at most twice (once during iteration and once during stack operations).

4. Space complexity is O(n) for the stack storage.

5. Comprehensive test cases to verify the implementation works correctly.

6. Clear documentation and comments explaining the implementation details.

7. Type hints and proper Python conventions followed.

The solution handles various edge cases:
- Arrays with fewer than 3 elements
- Empty arrays
- Arrays with negative numbers
- Arrays with duplicate numbers

To use this implementation, you can either:
1. Run it directly to execute the test cases
2. Import the Solution class and use it in your code
3. Modify the test cases or add new ones as needed

The code follows PEP 8 style guidelines and includes proper error handling and input validation.
