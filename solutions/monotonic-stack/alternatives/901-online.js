 * Online Stock Span Implementation The stock span problem is to calculate span of stock's price for all n days. The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and going backwards) for which the price of the stock was less than or equal to today's price.

 * ### INTUITION:
 * The key insight for solving Online is to understand the core problem pattern
 * and apply the most efficient algorithmic approach.
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. Analyze the problem requirements
 * 2. Choose the optimal data structure
 * 3. Implement the solution step by step
 * 4. Handle edge cases appropriately
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * This approach works because it leverages the fundamental properties of the problem
 * to achieve an efficient solution.
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * For a typical input, the algorithm processes the data systematically
 * to produce the expected output.
