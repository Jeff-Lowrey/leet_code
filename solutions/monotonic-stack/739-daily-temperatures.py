I'll help you create a solution for the Daily Temperatures Monotonic problem. I'll write a clean, well-commented implementation that follows Python best practices.

Daily Temperatures Monotonic - Solution
-------------------------------------

Problem:
Given an array of daily temperatures, return an array such that, for each day,
tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature.
If there is no future day with a warmer temperature, put 0 instead.

Example:
Input: temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
Output: [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Approach:
- Use a monotonic decreasing stack to track temperatures
- Stack stores indices instead of temperatures for easy day difference calculation
- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of temperatures array
- Space Complexity: O(n) for the stack

This implementation includes:

1. Clear documentation and problem description
2. Type hints for better code readability
3. Efficient solution using a monotonic stack
4. Comprehensive test cases
5. Example usage in the main block
6. Proper error handling and edge cases
7. Clean code structure following Python conventions

The solution uses a monotonic stack approach which is optimal for this problem, with O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity. The code is well-structured and includes test cases to verify the implementation works correctly for various scenarios.

The file can be saved to the specified path and run directly to test the implementation.
