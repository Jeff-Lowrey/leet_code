Next Greater Element II - Python Implementation

This module provides a solution for finding the next greater element for each element
in a circular array. For each element, it finds the first greater element that occurs
after it in the array. If no greater element exists, it returns -1.

Example:
    Input: nums = [1,2,1]
    Output: [2,-1,2]

This implementation includes:

1. A `Solution` class with the `nextGreaterElements` method that solves the Next Greater Element II problem
2. Comprehensive documentation and comments explaining the approach
3. Time and space complexity analysis
4. Test cases covering various scenarios
5. Example usage demonstration
6. Type hints for better code readability and IDE support

The solution uses a stack-based approach to efficiently find the next greater elements in a circular array. It simulates the circular nature of the array by iterating through it twice and using modulo operation.

Key features of the implementation:
- Handles edge cases (empty array, single element)
- Uses a stack to track indices
- Simulates circular array behavior
- Includes comprehensive test cases
- Follows Python best practices and PEP 8 conventions

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input array, and the space complexity is O(n) for the stack and result array.
