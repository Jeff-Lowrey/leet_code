# Difficulty: Medium

# 316. Remove

Given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>"bcabc"</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"abc"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>After removing duplicate letters while maintaining lexicographical order, result is 'abc'</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Use monotonic increasing stack. For each character, while stack top > current character, pop if we can remove it (count > 0 and appears later). This ensures lexicographically smallest result.

### APPROACH:
1. **Count occurrences**: Create counter for each character's frequency
2. **Initialize stack and visited**: stack = [], visited = set()
3. **Iterate through string**: For each char in s
4. **Decrement count**: counter[char] -= 1
5. **Skip if visited**: If char in visited, continue
6. **Maintain order**: While stack and stack[-1] > char and counter[stack[-1]] > 0, pop and remove from visited
7. **Add current**: Append char to stack, add to visited
8. **Return result**: Return ''.join(stack)

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Monotonic stack builds lexicographically smallest result
- Track remaining count of each char: safe to remove if appears later
- Pop larger chars from stack if count > 0 (can add back later)
- Visited set prevents duplicate characters in result
- Greedy approach works: always try to place smaller char earlier

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: s = "bcabc"
Step 1: Count frequencies and track remaining
  freq = {'b':2, 'c':2, 'a':1}

Step 2: Build result with monotonic stack
  Add 'b': stack=['b']
  Add 'c': stack=['b','c']
  Add 'a': pop 'c' (a<c, c appears later), pop 'b' (a<b, b appears later)
          stack=['a']
  Add 'b': stack=['a','b']
  Add 'c': stack=['a','b','c']

Output: "abc"
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
