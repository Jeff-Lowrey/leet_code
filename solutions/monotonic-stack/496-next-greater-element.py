496. Next Greater Element I
Easy

The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater
element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct `0-indexed` integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1
is a subset of nums2.

For each `0 <= i` < nums1.length, find the index `j` such that nums1[i] == nums2[j]
and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater
element as described above.

Example:
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Use a monotonic decreasing stack to efficiently find the next greater element for each number in nums2. The stack maintains elements in decreasing order, so when we find a larger element, we can pop and match all smaller elements with their next greater element.

### APPROACH:
1. Traverse nums2 with a stack
2. For each element, pop all smaller elements from stack and map them to current element
3. Push current element to stack
4. Build result array by looking up each nums1 element in the mapping

### WHY THIS WORKS:
The monotonic stack ensures we process elements in the correct order. When we encounter a larger element, all smaller elements in the stack have found their next greater element. Elements remaining in the stack have no next greater element.

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n + m)
### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n)

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
nums2 = [1,3,4,2], nums1 = [4,1,2]
- Process 1: stack=[1]
- Process 3: 3>1, map[1]=3, stack=[3]
- Process 4: 4>3, map[3]=4, stack=[4]
- Process 2: 2<4, stack=[4,2]
- Final mapping: {1:3, 3:4, 4:-1, 2:-1}
- Result for [4,1,2]: [-1,3,-1]

503. Next Greater Element II
Medium

Given a circular integer array nums, return the next greater number for every
element in nums.

The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its
traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly.

901. Online Stock Span
Medium

Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns

The span of the stock's price in one day is the maximum number of consecutive
days (starting from that day and going backward) for which the stock price was
less than or equal to the price of that day.
