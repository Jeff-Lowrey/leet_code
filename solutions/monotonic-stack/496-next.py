Next Greater Element Implementation

This module provides a solution to find the next greater element for each element in an array.
For each element, the next greater element is the first greater element that appears to its right.
If no greater element exists, return -1 for that element.

This implementation provides two methods for finding next greater elements:

1. `nextGreaterElement`: Finds next greater elements for elements in nums1 within nums2
2. `nextGreaterElements`: Finds next greater elements in a circular array

Key features of the implementation:

1. Uses a stack-based approach for efficient processing
2. Handles both regular and circular array scenarios
3. Includes comprehensive comments and documentation
4. Provides example usage in the main function
5. Follows Python best practices and type hints
6. Handles edge cases appropriately

The solution uses a monotonic stack approach which provides optimal time complexity O(n) and space complexity O(n).

The code includes test cases demonstrating different scenarios:
- Regular array lookup
- Circular array processing
- Edge case with decreasing sequence

The implementation is complete and ready to use, with proper error handling and documentation.
