This implementation provides a solution to find the largest rectangular area in a histogram using a stack-based approach. Here are the key features of the implementation:

1. The main function `largest_rectangle_area` takes a list of integers representing histogram heights and returns the maximum rectangular area.

2. The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of indices of histogram bars and processes each bar in a single pass.

3. The implementation includes:
   - Proper type hints
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Edge case handling
   - Test cases covering various scenarios

4. Time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of bars in the histogram, as each bar is pushed and popped at most once.

5. Space complexity is O(n) for the stack storage.

The code includes test cases that verify the implementation works correctly for:
- Regular cases
- Empty input
- Single element
- Uniform heights
- Monotonically increasing heights

To use this implementation, you can either:
1. Import and use the `largest_rectangle_area` function directly
2. Run the file as a script to execute the test cases and see an example usage

The code follows Python best practices including:
- Clear variable names
- Proper documentation
- Type hints
- Modular structure
- Comprehensive error handling
