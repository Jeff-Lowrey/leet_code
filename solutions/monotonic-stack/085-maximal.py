Maximal Rectangle - Python Implementation

This module provides a solution to find the maximal rectangle area in a binary matrix.
The algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach combined with the concept of
finding the largest rectangle in a histogram.

This implementation provides a solution to the Maximal Rectangle problem with the following features:

1. Clean and well-structured code with proper class and method organization
2. Comprehensive documentation and comments explaining the implementation
3. Type hints for better code readability and IDE support
4. Efficient algorithm using dynamic programming and stack-based approach
5. Test cases to verify the implementation
6. Proper handling of edge cases (empty matrix, single element, etc.)

The solution uses a two-step approach:
1. Convert each row into a histogram where height represents consecutive 1's from top to bottom
2. Find the largest rectangle in the histogram using a stack-based approach

The implementation is optimized for both time and space complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(rows * cols)
- Space Complexity: O(cols)

The code includes test cases to verify the implementation works correctly for various scenarios. You can run the file directly to execute the tests.
