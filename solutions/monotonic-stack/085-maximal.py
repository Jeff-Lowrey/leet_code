# Difficulty: Medium

# 085. Maximal

Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"]]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>3 (maximal rectangle)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Maximal rectangle area is 6</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
For each row, treat it as base of histogram. Heights are consecutive 1s above in each column. Apply largest rectangle in histogram for each row. Track maximum across all rows.

### APPROACH:
1. **Build height array**: For each row, treat as base of histogram
2. **Update heights**: For each row, if cell is '1', heights[j] += 1; else heights[j] = 0
3. **Apply histogram algorithm**: For each row's height array, call largestRectangleInHistogram
4. **Track maximum**: Update max_area with result from histogram calculation
5. **Continue for all rows**: Process entire matrix
6. **Return result**: Return max_area

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Treat each row as histogram base: heights = consecutive 1s above
- Apply largest rectangle in histogram algorithm to each row
- Update heights: if cell is 1, heights[j]++; if 0, heights[j]=0
- Max rectangle found by processing all rows as histograms
- O(m*n) time: histogram calculation O(n) per row, O(n) space for heights array

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"]]
Step 1: Build height array for each row
  row 0: heights = [1,0,1,0,0]
  row 1: heights = [2,0,2,1,1]

Step 2: Find max rectangle in each histogram
  row 0: max = 1
  row 1: max = 3

Output: 3 (maximal rectangle)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
