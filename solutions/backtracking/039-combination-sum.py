I'll help you implement a solution for the Combination Sum problem. I'll create a clean, well-documented implementation that follows Python best practices.

Combination Sum - Python Implementation

This module provides a solution to find all unique combinations of candidates
where the chosen numbers sum to a target value. Each number in candidates
may be used an unlimited number of times.

Example:
    Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
    Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]

This implementation includes:

1. A clear module docstring explaining the problem and providing an example
2. Type hints using the `typing` module
3. A well-structured `Solution` class with the main implementation
4. Detailed comments explaining the algorithm and its components
5. A backtracking approach to find all valid combinations
6. Time and space complexity analysis in the docstring
7. Helper function for the recursive backtracking implementation
8. Test cases to verify the solution
9. Proper Python conventions and best practices
10. Edge case handling

The solution uses a backtracking approach to find all possible combinations. It:
- Sorts the candidates first for optimization
- Uses a recursive helper function to build combinations
- Maintains a current combination and explores possible additions
- Handles base cases and invalid combinations
- Returns all valid combinations that sum to the target

The code is complete and ready to be saved to the specified file path. You can run it directly to execute the test cases and verify the implementation.
