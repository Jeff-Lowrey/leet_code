# 039. Combination Sum

Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target,
return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target.
You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times.
Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[[1, 1]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"Expected {expected}, got {result}"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>All combinations summing to 7 using [2,3,6,7] are [[2,2,3], [7]]</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
This is a classic backtracking problem where we need to find all combinations that sum to target.
Since numbers can be reused unlimited times, we explore each candidate multiple times.

### APPROACH:
1. **Sort candidates**: For optimization and early termination
2. **Use backtracking**: Build combinations incrementally
3. **Two choices per element**: Include it (allowing reuse) or skip it
4. **Base cases**: Sum equals target (valid) or exceeds target (invalid)

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Backtracking explores all possible combinations systematically
- Sorting allows early termination when candidate > remaining sum
- Using start index prevents duplicate combinations

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Combinations found: [[2,2,3], [7]]
- Try 2: [2] -> remaining=5, try 2 again: [2,2] -> remaining=3, try 3: [2,2,3] ‚úì
- Try 7: [7] -> remaining=0 ‚úì
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(N^(T/M))
Where N=len(candidates), T=target, M=minimal candidate value

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(T/M)
For recursion depth and storing combinations

### EDGE CASES:
- Target = 0: return [[]]
- No valid combinations: return []
- Single candidate equals target: return [[candidate]]
