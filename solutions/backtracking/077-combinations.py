I'll help you create a clean and efficient implementation of the combinations problem in Python. Here's the complete solution:

Combinations - Python Implementation
This module provides a solution for generating all possible combinations of k numbers from 1 to n.

Example:
    Input: n = 4, k = 2
    Output: [[1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [2,3], [2,4], [3,4]]

This implementation provides two approaches to generate combinations:

1. A recursive backtracking solution (`combine` method)
2. An iterative solution (`combine_iterative` method)

Key features of this implementation:

1. Clean and well-structured code following Python conventions
2. Comprehensive documentation with docstrings
3. Type hints for better code readability and IDE support
4. Both recursive and iterative implementations for comparison
5. Main function with test cases to demonstrate usage
6. Proper error handling and edge cases consideration
7. Efficient algorithms using backtracking and iterative approaches

The code can be run directly to see the combinations generated for various test cases. The recursive solution uses backtracking, which is more intuitive but might use more memory for large inputs. The iterative solution is more space-efficient but slightly less intuitive to understand.

To use this code, simply call either `combine()` or `combine_iterative()` method with appropriate `n` and `k` values. The code includes a main function that demonstrates usage with several test cases.
