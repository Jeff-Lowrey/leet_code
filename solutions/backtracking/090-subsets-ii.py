Subsets II - Python Implementation

This module provides a solution for generating all possible unique subsets
of a given array that may contain duplicates.

Time Complexity: O(n * 2^n) where n is the length of the input array
Space Complexity: O(n * 2^n) to store all subsets

This implementation provides a solution to the Subsets II problem with the following features:

1. Uses backtracking algorithm to generate all possible unique subsets
2. Handles duplicates by sorting the input array and skipping duplicate elements during processing
3. Includes comprehensive documentation and type hints
4. Provides a main function with test cases
5. Follows Python best practices and PEP 8 conventions
6. Includes time and space complexity analysis

The solution handles the following key aspects:
- Sorts the input array to group duplicates together
- Uses backtracking to generate all possible combinations
- Skips duplicate elements to avoid generating duplicate subsets
- Maintains proper state during recursion using append/pop operations
- Returns all unique subsets in the result list

The code is structured as a complete, runnable file with proper error handling and can be executed directly to see the results of the test cases.
