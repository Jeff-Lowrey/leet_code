### INTUITION:
The key insight is that generate all permutations by systematically trying each unused element at each position. Use backtracking to explore all possibilities while maintaining state through choices and un-choices.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize result list**: Create an empty list to store all permutations
2. **Define recursive backtracking function**: Create a helper function that builds permutations by maintaining a current partial permutation
3. **Base case check**: If the current permutation length equals the input array length, we have a complete permutation - add a copy to results
4. **Iterate through all elements**: For each element in the original array, check if it's not already in the current permutation
5. **Make choice and recurse**: Add the element to current permutation, recursively call backtrack to continue building
6. **Backtrack**: Remove the last added element (undo choice) to try other possibilities
7. **Return all permutations**: After exploring all branches, return the complete list of permutations

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Each permutation uses every element exactly once
- Backtracking ensures we explore all n! permutations
- Checking "not in current" ensures no duplicates within a permutation
- Systematic exploration guarantees all permutations are found

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
Input:
```
nums = [1, 2, 3]
```

Step 1: backtrack([])
Try 1: current = [1]
Try 2: current = [1,2]
Try 3: current = [1,2,3] ✓ Complete! Add to result
Remove 3: current = [1,2]
Remove 2: current = [1]
Try 3: current = [1,3]
Try 2: current = [1,3,2] ✓ Complete! Add to result
Remove 2: current = [1,3]
Remove 3: current = [1]
Remove 1: current = []
Step 2: Try 2: current = [2]
Try 1: current = [2,1]
Try 3: current = [2,1,3] ✓ Complete! Add to result
Try 3: current = [2,3]
Try 1: current = [2,3,1] ✓ Complete! Add to result
Step 3: Try 3: current = [3]
Try 1: current = [3,1]
Try 2: current = [3,1,2] ✓ Complete! Add to result
Try 2: current = [3,2]
Try 1: current = [3,2,1] ✓ Complete! Add to result

Output:
```
[[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
**O(n × n!)** - where n is the number of elements in the input array. There are n! (n factorial) possible permutations of n distinct elements. For each permutation, we perform **O(n)** work: checking membership in the current permutation (**O(n)** for list lookup), adding elements (**O(1)**), and copying the complete permutation to the result (**O(n)**). Therefore, the total time complexity is **O(n!)** permutations × **O(n)** work per permutation = **O(n × n!)**. Note that while the first call explores n choices, the second explores n-1, then n-2, etc., giving us n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1 = n! total paths.

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
**O(n)** - where n is the number of elements in the input array. The recursion call stack can go as deep as n levels (one level for each element we add to the current permutation). At each level, we maintain a current permutation list that grows from size 0 to size n. The maximum stack depth is n when we have a complete permutation. Additionally, the current permutation list takes **O(n)** space. The result list storing all permutations is not counted toward space complexity as it's required output. Total auxiliary space: **O(n)** for recursion stack + **O(n)** for current permutation = **O(n)**.

### EDGE CASES:
- **Empty array**: Return [[]] (empty permutation)
- **Single element**: Return [[element]]
- **Two elements**: Return both orderings [[a,b], [b,a]]
- **Duplicate elements (in variant)**: Use frequency counter to avoid duplicates
- **Large arrays**: n! permutations, factorial growth
