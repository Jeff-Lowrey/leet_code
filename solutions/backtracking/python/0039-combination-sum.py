### INTUITION:
This is a classic backtracking problem where we need to find all combinations that sum to target.
Since numbers can be reused unlimited times, we explore each candidate multiple times.

### APPROACH:
1. **Sort candidates**: For optimization and early termination
2. **Use backtracking**: Build combinations incrementally
3. **Two choices per element**: Include it (allowing reuse) or skip it
4. **Base cases**: Sum equals target (valid) or exceeds target (invalid)

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- This ensures that backtracking explores all possible combinations systematically
- This ensures that sorting allows early termination when candidate > remaining sum
- This ensures that using start index prevents duplicate combinations

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
Input:
```
candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
```

Combinations found: [[2,2,3], [7]]

Steps:
Step 1: - Try 2: [2] -> remaining=5, try 2 again: [2,2] -> remaining=3, try 3: [2,2,3] ✓
Step 2: - Try 7: [7] -> remaining=0 ✓

Output:
```
[Expected output]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
**O(N^(T/M))** - where N is the number of candidates, T is the target value, and M is the minimal candidate value. In the worst case, we explore a tree where each node has N choices (all candidates), and the maximum depth is T/M (when we repeatedly pick the smallest candidate). The number of nodes in this tree is bounded by N^(T/M). For each complete combination, we perform **O(T/M)** work to copy it. This gives us **O(N^(T/M)** × (T/M)) total time, but the N^(T/M) term dominates.

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
**O(T/M)** - where T is the target and M is the minimal candidate value. The recursion call stack depth is at most T/M levels (when we repeatedly use the smallest candidate to reach the target). The current combination list can grow to size at most T/M. The result list is not counted as it's required output. Total auxiliary space: **O(T/M)** for recursion stack + **O(T/M)** for current combination = **O(T/M)**.

### EDGE CASES:
- **Empty input**: Handle when input is empty
- **Single element**: Handle single-element inputs
- **Boundary values**: Handle minimum/maximum valid values
