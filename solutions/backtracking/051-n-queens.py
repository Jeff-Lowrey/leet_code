# 051. N Queens
**Hard**

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard
such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
You may return the answer in any order.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement,
where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

Example 1:
Input: n = 4
Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]

Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: [["Q"]]

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Place queens one row at a time and backtrack when conflicts arise. Queens attack horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, so we need to ensure no two queens can attack each other.

### APPROACH:
1. **Row by row placement**: Place one queen per row to avoid horizontal conflicts
2. **Column tracking**: Track which columns are occupied to avoid vertical conflicts
3. **Diagonal tracking**: Track both diagonal directions to avoid diagonal conflicts
4. **Backtrack**: When placement impossible, backtrack and try next position
5. **Build solution**: When all queens placed successfully, add board to results

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Placing one queen per row eliminates horizontal conflicts automatically
- Column and diagonal tracking prevents vertical and diagonal conflicts
- Backtracking explores all valid placements systematically
- Early pruning prevents exploring invalid partial solutions

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(N!)
- In worst case, we try every possible placement
- First queen has N choices, second has (N-1), etc.
- But pruning significantly reduces actual combinations

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(N)
- Recursion depth is N (one call per row)
- Additional space for tracking columns and diagonals
- Board representation space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH (N=4):
```
Row 0: Try col 0 -> Check conflicts -> No conflicts, place queen
Row 1: Try col 0 -> Conflict (same column) -> Try col 1 -> Conflict (diagonal)
       -> Try col 2 -> No conflicts, place queen
Row 2: Try col 0 -> No conflicts, place queen
Row 3: Try col 0 -> Conflict -> Try col 1 -> Conflict -> Try col 2 -> Conflict
       -> Try col 3 -> No conflicts, place queen -> Solution found!

Result: [".Q..", "...Q", "Q...", "..Q."]
```

### CONFLICT DETECTION:
- **Column conflict**: column already used
- **Diagonal conflicts**:
  - Main diagonal (‚Üò): row - col is same for conflicting positions
  - Anti-diagonal (‚Üô): row + col is same for conflicting positions

### OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Use sets for O(1) conflict checking instead of O(N) board scanning
- Track conflicts directly instead of checking entire board each time
- Early termination when conflicts detected

<details>
<summary><b>üí° APPROACH</b></summary>

The approach uses backtracking with conflict tracking:

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Create sets to track occupied columns and diagonals
2. For each row, try placing queen in each column
3. Check for conflicts using the tracking sets
4. If no conflicts, place queen and recurse to next row
5. If all rows filled, add solution to results
6. Backtrack by removing queen and trying next position

### Conflict Tracking:
- `cols`: tracks occupied columns
- `diag1`: tracks main diagonal (row - col)
- `diag2`: tracks anti-diagonal (row + col)
