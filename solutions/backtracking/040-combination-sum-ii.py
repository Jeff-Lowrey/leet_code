# 040. Combination Sum Ii

Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to target.

Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[[1,1,6]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"Expected {expected}, got {result}"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>All unique combinations summing to 8 from [10,1,2,7,6,1,5] are [[1,1,6],[1,2,5],[1,7],[2,6]]</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Sort the candidates first to handle duplicates. During backtracking, skip duplicate elements at the same recursion level by checking if nums[i] == nums[i-1] and i > start. Each number can only be used once, so advance the index by 1 after including a number.

### APPROACH:
1. **Sort candidates**: Sort candidates array to group duplicates together for easy skipping
2. **Initialize result**: Create empty result list and current combination list
3. **Define backtrack function**: Create recursive function with parameters (start, current, remaining_target)
# 4. **Base case**: If remaining_target == 0, add copy of current to result and return  # Result undefined
5. **Iterate from start**: Loop from start index to end of candidates array
6. **Skip duplicates**: If i > start and candidates[i] == candidates[i-1], continue to avoid duplicate combinations
7. **Prune search**: If candidates[i] > remaining_target, break early since array is sorted
8. **Recursive call**: Add candidates[i] to current, call backtrack(i+1, current, remaining_target - candidates[i]), then remove last element

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Sort array to enable duplicate skipping
- Skip duplicates: if i > start and candidates[i] == candidates[i-1], skip
- Backtracking tries including/excluding each candidate
- Pass start index to avoid reusing earlier elements
- O(2^n) time: each element in/out, sorting adds O(n log n)

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8
Step 1: Sort candidates ‚Üí [1,1,2,5,6,7,10]

Step 2: Backtrack to find combinations
  Try 1: curr = [1], remain = 7
    Try 1: curr = [1,1], remain = 6
      Try 2: curr = [1,1,2], remain = 4 ‚Üí continue
      Try 5: curr = [1,1,5], remain = 1 ‚Üí continue
      Try 6: curr = [1,1,6], remain = 0 ‚Üí add [1,1,6]
    Skip duplicate 1 at position 2
    Try 2: curr = [1,2], remain = 5
      Try 5: curr = [1,2,5], remain = 0 ‚Üí add [1,2,5]
    Try 7: curr = [1,7], remain = 0 ‚Üí add [1,7]
  Skip duplicate 1 at position 1
  Try 2: curr = [2], remain = 6
    Try 6: curr = [2,6], remain = 0 ‚Üí add [2,6]

Output: [[1,1,6],[1,2,5],[1,7],[2,6]]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
