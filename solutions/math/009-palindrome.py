I'll help you create a solution for the Palindrome Number implementation in Python. Here's the complete code with comments and proper structure:

Palindrome Number Implementation
This module provides a solution to determine if a given integer is a palindrome.
A number is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example:
    121 is a palindrome
    -121 is not a palindrome
    10 is not a palindrome

            return True

This implementation includes:

1. Two different approaches to solve the palindrome number problem:
   - String-based solution (simple and readable)
   - Mathematical solution (without string conversion)

2. Proper handling of edge cases:
   - Negative numbers
   - Single-digit numbers
   - Numbers ending with 0

3. Clear documentation and comments explaining the code

4. A main function to demonstrate the usage with test cases

5. Proper Python conventions and best practices:
   - Type hints
   - Docstrings
   - Clean code structure

6. The code is complete and runnable, with example test cases

To use this code, you can either:
1. Import the Solution class and use its methods directly
2. Run the file as a script to see the example test cases

The file will be saved as `generated/MT-009-PY_palindrome_number___python_implementation.py` and can be executed directly to see the palindrome checker in action.
