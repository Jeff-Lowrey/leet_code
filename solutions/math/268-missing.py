I'll help you create a solution for the Missing Number problem. I'll write a clean, well-documented implementation that follows Python best practices.

Missing Number - Python Implementation

This module provides a solution for finding the missing number in a sequence
of n numbers where the sequence contains distinct numbers from 0 to n,
with one number missing.

Example:
    Input: nums = [3,0,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3].
    2 is the missing number since it does not appear in nums.

This implementation provides two different approaches to solve the Missing Number problem:

1. **Sum Method**: Uses the mathematical formula for the sum of first n numbers and compares it with the actual sum of the array to find the missing number.

2. **XOR Method**: Uses the XOR operation properties to find the missing number. This is a bit manipulation approach that's memory efficient.

The code includes:
- Proper documentation and type hints
- Two different implementation approaches
- Test cases in the main function
- Clean code structure following PEP 8 guidelines
- Error handling through type hints
- Efficient algorithms with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity

The file can be run directly to test the implementation with various test cases. Both methods will produce the same results but use different approaches, demonstrating alternative ways to solve the problem.
