I'll help you create a solution for the Power of Three problem. I'll write a clean, well-documented implementation that checks if a given number is a power of 3.

Power of Three Implementation

This module provides a solution to determine if a given integer is a power of three.
A number is considered a power of three if it can be expressed as 3^n where n is a non-negative integer.

Example:
    1 = 3^0 (True)
    3 = 3^1 (True)
    9 = 3^2 (True)
    27 = 3^3 (True)
    45 = not a power of three (False)

This implementation provides two different approaches to solve the Power of Three problem:

1. `isPowerOfThree`: An iterative solution that repeatedly divides the number by 3 and checks for remainders.
2. `isPowerOfThreeOptimized`: A mathematical solution using the fact that the largest power of 3 in a 32-bit integer is 3^19.

The code includes:
- Proper documentation and comments
- Type hints for better code readability
- Error handling for edge cases
- A main function with test cases
- Both a standard and optimized solution
- Following Python naming conventions and best practices

The file can be run directly to see the results of various test cases, or the Solution class can be imported and used in other code.

To run the code:
```bash
python3 generated/MT-326-PY_power_of_three___python_implementation.py
```

This will execute the test cases and show which numbers are powers of three.
