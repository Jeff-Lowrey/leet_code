I'll help you implement a solution for finding the square root of a number (Sqrt X) in Python. I'll create a clean, well-documented implementation that handles edge cases and follows best practices.

Square Root (Sqrt X) Implementation

This module provides a solution for computing the square root of a non-negative integer
using the binary search approach. Returns the floor value of the square root.

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

This implementation includes:

1. A clean and efficient solution using binary search algorithm
2. Proper documentation with docstrings
3. Clear comments explaining the logic
4. Edge case handling (0 and 1)
5. A main function for demonstration
6. Example test cases
7. Time and space complexity analysis

The solution uses binary search to efficiently find the square root, which has a time complexity of O(log n). The implementation returns the floor value of the square root for non-perfect squares.

Key features:
- Handles edge cases (0 and 1) separately
- Uses binary search for efficient computation
- Maintains the floor value during search
- Includes comprehensive documentation
- Provides example usage through the main function

The code follows Python best practices and PEP 8 style guidelines. It's structured as a complete, runnable file that can be executed directly or imported as a module.
