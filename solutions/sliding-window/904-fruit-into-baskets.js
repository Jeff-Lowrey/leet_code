I'll help you create a solution for the Fruit Baskets implementation in JavaScript. I'll create a clean, well-documented solution that follows best practices.

```javascript
/**
 * Fruit Baskets - JavaScript Implementation
 * 
 * This solution implements the fruit baskets problem where we need to find
 * the longest sequence of fruits that contains at most two different types.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input array
 * Space Complexity: O(1) as we only use a fixed-size map
 */

/**
 * @param {number[]} fruits - Array of integers representing different types of fruits
 * @return {number} - Length of longest sequence containing at most 2 different fruit types
 */
function totalFruit(fruits) {
    // Handle edge cases
    if (!fruits || fruits.length === 0) return 0;
    if (fruits.length <= 2) return fruits.length;

    // Map to store the count of each fruit type in current window
    const basketMap = new Map();
    
    let maxLength = 0;        // Track maximum sequence length
    let windowStart = 0;      // Start of sliding window
    
    // Iterate through the fruits array using sliding window
    for (let windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < fruits.length; windowEnd++) {
        const currentFruit = fruits[windowEnd];
        
        // Add current fruit to basket map
        basketMap.set(currentFruit, (basketMap.get(currentFruit) || 0) + 1);
        
        // Shrink window while we have more than 2 types of fruits
        while (basketMap.size > 2) {
            const leftFruit = fruits[windowStart];
            basketMap.set(leftFruit, basketMap.get(leftFruit) - 1);
            
            // Remove fruit type if count becomes 0
            if (basketMap.get(leftFruit) === 0) {
                basketMap.delete(leftFruit);
            }
            
            windowStart++;
        }
        
        // Update maximum length
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, windowEnd - windowStart + 1);
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}

/**
 * Test cases
 */
function runTests() {
    const testCases = [
        {
            input: [1, 2, 1],
            expected: 3,
            description: "Basic case with three fruits"
        },
        {
            input: [0, 1, 2, 2],
            expected: 3,
            description: "Case with consecutive same fruits"
        },
        {
            input: [1, 2, 3, 2, 2],
            expected: 4,
            description: "Case with multiple different fruits"
        },
        {
            input: [],
            expected: 0,
            description: "Empty array"
        },
        {
            input: [1],
            expected: 1,
            description: "Single fruit"
        }
    ];

    testCases.forEach((testCase, index) => {
        const result = totalFruit(testCase.input);
        console.log(`Test ${index + 1}: ${testCase.description}`);
        console.log(`Input: [${testCase.input}]`);
        console.log(`Expected: ${testCase.expected}`);
        console.log(`Got: ${result}`);
        console.log(`Status: ${result === testCase.expected ? 'PASSED' : 'FAILED'}`);
        console.log('---');
    });
}

// Export the function for use in other modules
module.exports = {
    totalFruit,
    runTests
};

// Run tests if this file is being run directly
if (require.main === module) {
    runTests();
}
```

This implementation provides a complete solution for the Fruit Baskets problem with the following features:

1. **Clean Code Structure**: The code is well-organized with clear function definitions and proper documentation.

2. **Efficient Algorithm**: Uses a sliding window approach with O(n) time complexity.

3. **Error Handling**: Includes handling of edge cases like empty arrays and arrays with less than 2 elements.

4. **Documentation**: Includes detailed comments explaining the implementation and complexity.

5. **Testing**: Includes a comprehensive test suite with various test cases.

6. **Best Practices**:
   - Uses modern JavaScript features
   - Follows consistent naming conventions
   - Implements proper error handling
   - Includes module exports for reusability

7. **Modularity**: Can be imported and used in other files or run directly as a standalone script.

The solution uses a sliding window approach with a Map to keep track of fruit types and their counts. It efficiently finds the longest sequence of fruits that contains at most two different types.

To use this code:
1. Import it as a module in another file
2. Run it directly to see test results
3. Use the `totalFruit` function with your own input arrays

The test cases cover various scenarios including edge cases and typical use cases.
