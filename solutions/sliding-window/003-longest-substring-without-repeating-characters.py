I'll help you create a solution for the Longest Substring problem. I'll implement a solution that finds the longest substring without repeating characters.

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters Implementation
This module provides a solution to find the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example:
    Input: "abcabcbb"
    Output: 3 (The longest substring is "abc")

This implementation includes:

1. A `Solution` class with the main algorithm implementation
2. Efficient sliding window approach with O(n) time complexity
3. Comprehensive test cases
4. Clear documentation and comments
5. Proper error handling and edge cases
6. Example usage demonstration

The solution uses a sliding window approach with a dictionary to keep track of character positions. It handles various edge cases and provides optimal performance for finding the longest substring without repeating characters.

The code follows Python best practices including:
- Type hints
- Docstrings
- Clear variable names
- Proper code organization
- Test cases
- Main guard for script execution
