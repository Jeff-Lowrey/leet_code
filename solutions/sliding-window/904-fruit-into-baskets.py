I'll help you create a solution for the Fruit Baskets implementation in Python. This will implement a sliding window approach to find the maximum number of fruits that can be collected with two baskets.

Fruit Baskets Implementation
---------------------------
This module implements a solution for the Fruit Baskets problem where we need to
find the maximum number of fruits that can be picked with two baskets, where each
basket can only hold one type of fruit.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input array
Space Complexity: O(1) as we only store at most 3 types of fruits in the window

This implementation includes:

1. A complete solution for the Fruit Baskets problem using a sliding window approach
2. Proper type hints and documentation
3. A comprehensive test suite with various test cases
4. Efficient implementation with O(n) time complexity
5. Proper error handling and edge cases
6. Clean code structure following Python conventions

The code uses a sliding window technique with a dictionary to keep track of fruit counts. It maintains a window that contains at most two types of fruits and expands/contracts the window to find the maximum number of fruits that can be picked.

Key features:
- Handles empty input arrays
- Properly manages the sliding window
- Uses defaultdict for convenient fruit counting
- Includes comprehensive test cases
- Well-documented with clear comments
- Follows PEP 8 style guidelines

To run the code, simply execute the file and it will run through the test cases showing the results for each one.
