# 904. Fruit Into Baskets

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where fruits[i] is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

- You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
- Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
- Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[1, 2, 3, 2, 2]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"Solution for 904. Fruit Into Baskets: {result}"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>You can collect at most 3 fruits with 2 types of baskets (type 1 and type 2)</dd>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Use sliding window tracking fruit types with hash map. Expand while <= 2 types. When 3rd type appears, shrink until back to 2 types. Track maximum window size.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize variables**: Set left = 0, max_fruits = 0, basket = {}
2. **Expand with right**: For right in range(len(fruits))
3. **Add to basket**: basket[fruits[right]] = basket.get(fruits[right], 0) + 1
4. **Check basket limit**: While len(basket) > 2, shrink window
5. **Remove from left**: basket[fruits[left]] -= 1, remove if 0, increment left
6. **Update maximum**: max_fruits = max(max_fruits, right - left + 1)
7. **Return result**: Return max_fruits

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Longest subarray with at most 2 distinct elements (fruit types)
- Hash map tracks count of each fruit type in current window
- Expand right adding fruits, contract left when > 2 types
- Remove fruit type when its count reaches 0 in map
- O(n) time: each element processed twice at most, O(1) space (at most 3 keys)

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: fruits = [1,2,1,2,3,1,1]
Step 1: Expand with at most 2 types
  [1,2,1,2]: types={1,2}, count=4
  [1,2,1,2,3]: types={1,2,3}, invalid

Step 2: Contract
  [2,1,2,3]: types={1,2,3}, invalid
  [1,2,3]: types={1,2,3}, invalid
  [2,3]: types={2,3}, valid
  [2,3,1,1]: types={2,3,1}, invalid
  [3,1,1]: types={3,1}, count=3

Output: 4 (maximum fruits)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
