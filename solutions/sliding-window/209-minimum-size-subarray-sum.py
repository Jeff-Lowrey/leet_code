Minimum Size Subarray Solution
LeetCode Problem 209: Minimum Size Subarray Sum

This module implements a solution to find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray
whose sum is greater than or equal to the target value.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input array
Space Complexity: O(1) as we only use a few variables

This implementation includes:

1. A `Solution` class with the `minSubArrayLen` method that solves the problem using a sliding window approach
2. Comprehensive documentation and comments explaining the implementation
3. Type hints for better code readability and IDE support
4. A test function with multiple test cases to verify the solution
5. Proper error handling and edge cases
6. Main block for example usage
7. Time and space complexity analysis in the module docstring

The solution uses the sliding window technique to efficiently find the minimum length subarray. It maintains a window with two pointers (left and right) and adjusts the window size while keeping track of the current sum. This approach achieves O(n) time complexity while using O(1) space.

The code handles various edge cases:
- Empty input array
- No solution exists
- Single element solution
- Multiple possible solutions

The test cases cover these scenarios to ensure the solution works correctly in all cases.
