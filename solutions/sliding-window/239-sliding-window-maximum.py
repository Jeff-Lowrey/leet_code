I'll help you implement the Max Sliding Window solution in Python. Here's the complete implementation:

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        """
        Find maximum elements in sliding windows of size k across an array.
        
        Args:
            nums: Input array of integers
            k: Size of sliding window
            
        Returns:
            List of maximum values for each sliding window
        """
        # Handle edge cases
        if not nums or k <= 0:
            return []
        if k == 1:
            return nums
            
        # Initialize result list and deque
        result = []
        dq = deque()  # Store indices of potential maximum values
        
        # Process first k elements (first window)
        for i in range(k):
            # Remove smaller elements from back
            while dq and nums[i] >= nums[dq[-1]]:
                dq.pop()
            dq.append(i)
            
        # Process rest of the elements
        for i in range(k, len(nums)):
            # Add maximum element from previous window
            result.append(nums[dq[0]])
            
            # Remove elements outside current window
            while dq and dq[0] <= i - k:
                dq.popleft()
                
            # Remove smaller elements from back
            while dq and nums[i] >= nums[dq[-1]]:
                dq.pop()
                
            # Add current element
            dq.append(i)
            
        # Add maximum element of last window
        result.append(nums[dq[0]])
        
        return result


def test_max_sliding_window():
    """
    Test function to verify the implementation
    """
    solution = Solution()
    
    # Test cases
    test_cases = [
        ([1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], 3, [3,3,5,5,6,7]),
        ([1], 1, [1]),
        ([1,-1], 1, [1,-1]),
        ([1,2,3,4,5], 3, [3,4,5]),
        ([], 0, [])
    ]
    
    for nums, k, expected in test_cases:
        result = solution.maxSlidingWindow(nums, k)
        assert result == expected, f"Test failed! Expected {expected}, but got {result}"
        print(f"Test passed! Input: nums={nums}, k={k}")
        
    print("All tests passed!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run tests
    test_max_sliding_window()
```

This implementation includes:

1. A `Solution` class with the `maxSlidingWindow` method that solves the problem using a deque-based approach
2. Comprehensive comments explaining the logic and implementation details
3. Proper type hints using the `typing` module
4. Edge case handling
5. A test function to verify the implementation
6. Main block to run tests

The solution uses a deque (double-ended queue) to maintain a window of potential maximum values. The algorithm:

1. Maintains indices of elements in decreasing order in the deque
2. Removes elements that are:
   - Outside the current window
   - Smaller than the current element (as they can't be maximum)
3. Returns the maximum element (front of deque) for each window

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input array, and space complexity is O(k) where k is the window size.

The implementation includes test cases to verify the correctness of the solution for various scenarios including edge cases.
