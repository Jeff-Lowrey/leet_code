# 076. Minimum Window Substring

Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>"ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"BANC"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Minimum window containing all chars of t='ABC' is 'BANC'</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Use sliding window with character counts. Expand right until window contains all t characters. Then shrink left while maintaining validity. Track minimum window. Use two frequency maps for comparison.

### APPROACH:
1. **Count target characters**: Use Counter(t) to get required character frequencies
2. **Initialize window variables**: Set left = 0, min_len = float('inf'), required = len(t_count), formed = 0
3. **Expand window with right**: For right in range(len(s)), add s[right] to window_counts
4. **Track formation**: If window_counts[char] == t_count[char], increment formed
5. **Contract window**: While formed == required, try shrinking from left
6. **Update minimum**: If current window smaller, update min_len and min_start
7. **Remove from left**: Remove s[left] from window, increment left
8. **Return result**: Return s[min_start:min_start+min_len] if found, else empty string

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Expanding window until all t chars included, then contract to minimize
- Two frequency maps: need (from t) and window (current counts)
- Have/need counters track how many unique chars satisfy frequency
- When have == need, try contracting left to find minimum
- O(m + n) time: scan s once, O(1) space for fixed alphabet

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Step 1: Expand window until valid
  "ADOBEC" contains A,B,C

Step 2: Contract from left
  "DOBEC" missing A
  "ADOBEC" is minimum so far (6 chars)

Step 3: Continue expanding
  "ODEBANC" contains A,B,C
  Contract: "BANC" (4 chars) - new minimum

Output: "BANC"
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
