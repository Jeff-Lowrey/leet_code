Minimum Window Substring Implementation

This module provides a solution to find the minimum window substring that contains
all characters from a target string.

Example:
    Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
    Output: "BANC"

This implementation includes:

1. A clean, efficient solution using the sliding window technique
2. Proper type hints and documentation
3. Clear comments explaining the logic
4. Test cases covering various scenarios
5. Proper error handling and edge cases
6. Following Python conventions and best practices

The solution uses a sliding window approach with two pointers (left and right) to find the minimum window substring. It maintains character frequency counters to track when a valid window is found and tries to minimize the window size while maintaining validity.

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the source string, and the space complexity is O(k) where k is the number of unique characters in the strings.

The code includes test cases to verify the implementation works correctly for various scenarios including normal cases, edge cases, and corner cases.
