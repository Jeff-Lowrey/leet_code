I'll help you create a JavaScript implementation for finding the longest substring without repeating characters. I'll write the solution with clear comments and proper structure.

```javascript
/**
 * Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
 * Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the string
 * Space Complexity: O(min(m,n)) where m is the size of the character set
 */

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
const lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
    // Handle edge cases
    if (!s) return 0;
    if (s.length === 1) return 1;

    // Initialize variables
    let maxLength = 0;
    let start = 0;
    let charMap = new Map();

    // Iterate through the string using sliding window technique
    for (let end = 0; end < s.length; end++) {
        const currentChar = s[end];

        // If we've seen this character before and it's in our current window
        if (charMap.has(currentChar) && charMap.get(currentChar) >= start) {
            // Move start pointer to position after the last occurrence
            start = charMap.get(currentChar) + 1;
        }

        // Update the character's position in our map
        charMap.set(currentChar, end);

        // Update maxLength if current window is larger
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
    }

    return maxLength;
};

// Test cases
const testCases = [
    "abcabcbb",    // Expected: 3 ("abc")
    "bbbbb",       // Expected: 1 ("b")
    "pwwkew",      // Expected: 3 ("wke")
    "",            // Expected: 0
    " ",           // Expected: 1
    "au",          // Expected: 2
    "dvdf"         // Expected: 3 ("vdf")
];

// Run test cases
console.log("Testing Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:");
testCases.forEach((test, index) => {
    console.log(`Test ${index + 1}:`);
    console.log(`Input: "${test}"`);
    console.log(`Output: ${lengthOfLongestSubstring(test)}`);
    console.log("---");
});

// Export the function for potential use in other modules
module.exports = {
    lengthOfLongestSubstring
};
```

This implementation includes:

1. A main function `lengthOfLongestSubstring` that uses the sliding window technique to find the longest substring without repeating characters.

2. Proper handling of edge cases (empty string, single character).

3. Efficient implementation using a Map to store character positions.

4. Time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the input string.

5. Space complexity of O(min(m,n)) where m is the size of the character set.

6. Test cases to verify the implementation.

7. Clear comments explaining the implementation and approach.

8. Module exports for potential use in other files.

The solution uses the sliding window technique with a hash map to track character positions. When a repeating character is found, the window's start is moved to the position after the last occurrence of that character. This ensures we maintain a window with unique characters while keeping track of the maximum length encountered.

The code follows JavaScript best practices and conventions, including:
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper variable declarations
- Clear code structure
- Efficient data structures
- Comprehensive test cases
- Proper error handling

You can run this code directly in Node.js, and it will output the results for all test cases.
