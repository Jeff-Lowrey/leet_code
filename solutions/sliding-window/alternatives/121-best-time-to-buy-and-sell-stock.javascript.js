I'll help you create a solution for the Buy Sell Stock problem in JavaScript. This will implement the algorithm to find the maximum profit from buying and selling a stock given an array of prices.

```javascript
/**
 * Buy Sell Stock - JavaScript Implementation
 * 
 * Problem: Given an array of stock prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on day i,
 * find the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling once.
 * Note that you must buy before you can sell.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 */

/**
 * Calculates the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling a stock once
 * @param {number[]} prices - Array of stock prices where prices[i] is the price on day i
 * @returns {number} - Maximum profit possible. Returns 0 if no profit can be made
 */
function maxProfit(prices) {
    // Handle edge cases
    if (!prices || prices.length < 2) {
        return 0;
    }

    let minPrice = Infinity;    // Track the minimum price seen so far
    let maxProfit = 0;         // Track the maximum profit possible

    // Iterate through each price
    for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
        // Update minimum price if current price is lower
        if (prices[i] < minPrice) {
            minPrice = prices[i];
        }
        // Calculate potential profit and update maxProfit if higher
        else {
            const currentProfit = prices[i] - minPrice;
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, currentProfit);
        }
    }

    return maxProfit;
}

// Test cases
const testCases = [
    {
        input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4],
        expected: 5,
        description: "Normal case with profit"
    },
    {
        input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1],
        expected: 0,
        description: "Decreasing prices - no profit"
    },
    {
        input: [2, 4, 1],
        expected: 2,
        description: "Small array"
    },
    {
        input: [],
        expected: 0,
        description: "Empty array"
    },
    {
        input: [1],
        expected: 0,
        description: "Single element"
    }
];

// Run test cases
function runTests() {
    console.log("Running Buy Sell Stock Tests:");
    console.log("-----------------------------");
    
    testCases.forEach((test, index) => {
        const result = maxProfit(test.input);
        const passed = result === test.expected;
        
        console.log(`Test ${index + 1}: ${test.description}`);
        console.log(`Input: [${test.input}]`);
        console.log(`Expected: ${test.expected}`);
        console.log(`Got: ${result}`);
        console.log(`Status: ${passed ? 'PASSED' : 'FAILED'}`);
        console.log("-----------------------------");
    });
}

// Execute tests
runTests();

// Export the function for potential use in other modules
module.exports = {
    maxProfit
};
```

This implementation includes:

1. A clear problem description and complexity analysis in the comments
2. The main `maxProfit` function that solves the Buy Sell Stock problem
3. Comprehensive error handling for edge cases
4. A test suite with various test cases
5. Clean code structure following JavaScript best practices
6. Proper documentation using JSDoc comments
7. Module exports for potential use in other files

The algorithm uses a single pass through the array, keeping track of the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit that could be made. This results in an O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

The test cases cover various scenarios including:
- Normal case with profit possible
- Decreasing prices with no profit possible
- Small arrays
- Edge cases (empty array and single element)

You can run this file directly with Node.js, and it will execute the test cases and show the results in the console.
