I'll help you create a solution for finding anagrams in Python. I'll implement it as a complete, well-structured file with proper comments and error handling.

Find Anagrams - Python Implementation
This module provides a solution for finding all anagrams of a pattern in a string.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string
Space Complexity: O(k) where k is the size of the character set (usually 26 for lowercase letters)

This implementation includes:

1. A complete solution using the sliding window technique
2. Proper type hints and documentation
3. Efficient implementation using Counter from collections
4. Edge case handling
5. Main function with test cases
6. Clear comments explaining the implementation
7. Proper Python conventions and best practices

The solution uses a sliding window approach with Counter objects to efficiently find all anagrams of a pattern in a string. The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input string, and space complexity is O(k) where k is the size of the character set (usually 26 for lowercase letters).

The code can be run directly to see the results of the test cases, or the Solution class can be imported and used in other code. It handles edge cases appropriately and provides clear error handling.
