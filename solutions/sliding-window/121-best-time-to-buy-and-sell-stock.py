Buy Sell Stock - Python Implementation

This module implements a solution to find the maximum profit that can be obtained
by buying and selling a stock once, given an array of daily prices.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the prices array
Space Complexity: O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space

This implementation includes:

1. A clear docstring explaining the purpose and complexity of the solution
2. Type hints for better code readability and IDE support
3. The main `max_profit` function that implements the solution using a single pass through the array
4. A `main` function with test cases to demonstrate the usage
5. Proper error handling for edge cases (empty array, single element)
6. Comments explaining the logic at key points
7. Clean code structure following Python conventions (PEP 8)

The algorithm works by:
1. Keeping track of the minimum price seen so far
2. For each price, calculating the potential profit if we sell at that price
3. Updating the maximum profit if the current potential profit is higher

The solution is optimal with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. It handles all edge cases and provides clear output for testing purposes.

To run the code, simply execute the file and it will run through the test cases showing the maximum profit possible for each scenario.
