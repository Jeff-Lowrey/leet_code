# 383. Ransom Note
# Difficulty: Easy
This problem demonstrates key concepts in Strings and Hash Tables.

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
To construct a ransom note from magazine letters, we need to ensure that the magazine contains
at least as many of each character as required by the ransom note. This is essentially checking
if one string's character frequencies are a subset of another's character frequencies.

### APPROACH:
1. **Count magazine characters**: Build a frequency map of all characters in the magazine
2. **Verify ransom note**: For each character in ransom note, check if available in magazine
3. **Decrement counts**: As we use characters from magazine, decrease their counts
4. **Return result**: If we can construct entire ransom note, return True; otherwise False

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Hash map provides O(1) lookup for character availability
- By counting magazine characters first, we know what's available
- Decrementing counts as we consume characters ensures we don't reuse
- If any character is unavailable or exhausted, we return False immediately

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(m + n)
Where m is the length of magazine and n is the length of ransomNote. We iterate through both
strings once.

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)
Although we use a hash map, since we're limited to lowercase English letters (26 characters),
the space is bounded by a constant.

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
Step 1: Count magazine chars: {'a': 2, 'b': 1}
Step 2: Check 'a' (first): count is 2, decrement to 1
Step 3: Check 'a' (second): count is 1, decrement to 0
Step 4: All characters available
Output: True

Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
Step 1: Count magazine chars: {'a': 1, 'b': 1}
Step 2: Check 'a' (first): count is 1, decrement to 0
Step 3: Check 'a' (second): count is 0, not available
Output: False
```

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty ransom note: Always True (can construct nothing from anything)
- Empty magazine: False if ransom note is non-empty, True if both empty
- Magazine shorter than ransom note: Could still be False
- Ransom note with characters not in magazine: False

<summary><b>üí° APPROACH</b></summary>

The approach uses frequency counting with a hash map (Counter from collections module).

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Import Counter from collections for efficient character counting
2. Count all characters in the magazine
3. For each character in ransom note:
   - Check if character is available (count > 0)
   - If not available, return False
   - If available, decrement the count
4. If all characters processed successfully, return True

### Alternative Approach:
Could also count both strings and compare counts: all ransomNote counts <= magazine counts.
