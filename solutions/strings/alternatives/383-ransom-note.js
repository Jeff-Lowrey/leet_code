 * # Difficulty: Easy

 * # 383. Ransom Note
 *
 * This problem demonstrates key concepts in Strings and Hash Tables.
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>True</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>The ransom note 'aa' cannot be constructed from magazine 'ab' (not enough 'a's)</dd>
 * </dl>

 * <details>
 * <summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>
 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * To construct a ransom note from magazine letters, we need to ensure that the magazine contains
 * at least as many of each character as required by the ransom note. This is essentially checking
 * if one string's character frequencies are a subset of another's character frequencies.
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Count magazine characters**: Build a frequency map of all characters in the magazine
 * 2. **Verify ransom note**: For each character in ransom note, check if available in magazine
 * 3. **Decrement counts**: As we use characters from magazine, decrease their counts
 * 4. **Return result**: If we can construct entire ransom note, return True; otherwise False
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * - Hash map provides O(1) lookup for character availability
 * - By counting magazine characters first, we know what's available
 * - Decrementing counts as we consume characters ensures we don't reuse
 * - If any character is unavailable or exhausted, we return False immediately
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
 * Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
 * Step 1: Count magazine chars: {'a': 2, 'b': 1}
 * Step 2: Check 'a' (first): count is 2, decrement to 1
 * Step 3: Check 'a' (second): count is 1, decrement to 0
 * Step 4: All characters available
 * Output: True
 *
 * Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
 * Step 1: Count magazine chars: {'a': 1, 'b': 1}
 * Step 2: Check 'a' (first): count is 1, decrement to 0
 * Step 3: Check 'a' (second): count is 0, not available
 * Output: False
 * ```
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(m + n)
 * Where m is the length of magazine and n is the length of ransomNote. We iterate through both
 * strings once.
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(1)
 * Although we use a hash map, since we're limited to lowercase English letters (26 characters),
 * the space is bounded by a constant.
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - Empty ransom note: Always True (can construct nothing from anything)
 * - Empty magazine: False if ransom note is non-empty, True if both empty
 * - Magazine shorter than ransom note: Could still be False
 * - Ransom note with characters not in magazine: False
