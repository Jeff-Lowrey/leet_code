 * # Difficulty: Medium

 * # 5. Longest Palindromic Substring
 *
 * This problem demonstrates key concepts in String manipulation and Dynamic Programming.
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>"babad"</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>"bab" (or "aba")</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>Longest palindromic substring is 'bab' or 'aba'</dd>
 * </dl>

 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. To find the longest palindromic substring,
 * we need to consider that palindromes expand around their center. A key insight is that every
 * palindrome has a center - either a single character (odd length) or between two characters
 * (even length). By checking all possible centers, we can find the longest palindrome.
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Expand around center technique**: For each possible center, expand outwards
 * 2. **Handle both cases**: Check odd-length (single center) and even-length (two centers)
 * 3. **Track maximum**: Keep track of the longest palindrome found so far
 * 4. **Extract substring**: Return the longest palindromic substring at the end
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * - Every palindrome has a center point
 * - By expanding from each center, we find all palindromes
 * - Comparing characters from center outward ensures palindrome property
 * - Checking all centers guarantees we find the longest one
 * - This avoids checking all O(n¬≤) substrings explicitly
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
 * Input: s = "babad"
 *
 * Centers to check:
 * - Index 0 ('b'): Expands to "b" (length 1)
 * - Between 0-1: "ba" not palindrome
 * - Index 1 ('a'): Expands to "bab" (length 3) ‚úì
 * - Between 1-2: "ab" not palindrome
 * - Index 2 ('b'): Expands to "aba" (length 3) ‚úì
 * - Between 2-3: "ba" not palindrome
 * - Index 3 ('a'): Expands to "a" (length 1)
 * - Between 3-4: "ad" not palindrome
 * - Index 4 ('d'): Expands to "d" (length 1)
 *
 * Longest found: "bab" or "aba" (both length 3)
 * Output: "bab" (or "aba")
 *
 * Input: s = "cbbd"
 * - Index 1 ('b'): Just "b"
 * - Between 1-2 ('bb'): Expands to "bb" (length 2) ‚úì
 * - This is the longest
 * Output: "bb"
 * ```
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(n¬≤)
 * There are n possible centers (including between characters), and each expansion can take up to
 * O(n) time in the worst case. Total: O(n¬≤).
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(1)
 * We only store indices and don't create additional data structures proportional to input.
 * The result substring is extracted at the end.
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - Single character: Return that character
 * - Empty string: Return empty string
 * - All same characters: Return entire string
 * - No palindrome longer than 1: Return first character
 * - Entire string is palindrome: Return entire string
