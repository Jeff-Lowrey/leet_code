# 28. Find The Index Of The First Occurrence In A String
**Easy**

This problem demonstrates key concepts in String matching and pattern searching.

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
This is the classic string matching problem (also known as finding a substring). We need to find
the first position where the needle (pattern) appears in the haystack (text). The straightforward
approach is to check each position in the haystack to see if the needle starts there.

### APPROACH:
1. **Handle edge cases**: If needle is empty, return 0 (convention)
2. **Iterate through valid positions**: Only check positions where needle could fit
3. **Check each position**: For each valid position, compare needle with substring
4. **Return on match**: As soon as we find a match, return the starting index
5. **Return -1 if not found**: If we complete the loop without finding needle

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- We systematically check every possible position where needle could start
- At each position, we verify if all characters of needle match
- We stop early if we find a mismatch at any position within needle
- The first match we find is guaranteed to be the earliest occurrence

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n * m)
Where n is the length of haystack and m is the length of needle. In the worst case, we check
every position (n - m + 1) and for each position compare m characters.

Note: More advanced algorithms like KMP or Rabin-Karp can achieve O(n + m), but for most
practical purposes and typical inputs, the simple approach is sufficient and easier to understand.

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)
We only use a few variables regardless of input size.

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Step 1: Check position 0: "sad" == "sad" ‚úì
Output: 0

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Step 1: Check position 0: "leetc" != "leeto" ‚úó
Step 2: Check position 1: "eetco" != "leeto" ‚úó
...continue checking...
Step n: No match found
Output: -1
```

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty needle: Return 0 (convention)
- Needle longer than haystack: Return -1
- Needle equals haystack: Return 0
- Needle not in haystack: Return -1
- Multiple occurrences: Return first one

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>üí° APPROACH</b></summary>

The approach uses a sliding window pattern matching technique.

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Handle edge case: if needle is empty, return 0
2. Calculate the last valid starting position (haystack length - needle length)
3. For each valid position i in haystack:
   - Compare substring haystack[i:i+len(needle)] with needle
   - If match found, return i
4. If no match found after checking all positions, return -1

### Python Built-in Alternative:
Python's str.find() method can also solve this, but implementing it manually demonstrates
understanding of the algorithm.
