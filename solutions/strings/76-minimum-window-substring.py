# 76. Minimum Window Substring
# Difficulty: Hard
This problem demonstrates key concepts in Sliding Window and Hash Tables.

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
We need to find the smallest substring of `s` that contains all characters from `t` (including
duplicates). This is a classic sliding window problem. The key insight is to use two pointers
to create a window, expand it to include all required characters, then contract it to find the
minimum window.

### APPROACH:
1. **Count target characters**: Build frequency map of characters in `t`
2. **Expand window**: Move right pointer to include characters until window is valid
3. **Contract window**: Move left pointer to shrink window while keeping it valid
4. **Track minimum**: Record the smallest valid window found
5. **Return result**: Extract and return the minimum window substring

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Sliding window technique efficiently explores all possible windows
- Hash maps provide O(1) character frequency tracking
- "formed" counter tracks how many unique characters have required frequency
- By expanding then contracting, we find all valid windows
- Only the minimum valid window is kept

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(|s| + |t|)
We iterate through `s` at most twice (once with right pointer, once with left pointer).
Building the target frequency map takes O(|t|). Total is O(|s| + |t|).

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(|s| + |t|)
In the worst case, all characters in `s` and `t` are unique, so our hash maps store O(|s| + |t|)
entries. In practice, for limited character sets (like ASCII), this is O(1).

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"

Step 1: Count target: {'A':1, 'B':1, 'C':1}, required = 3

Step 2: Expand window
- Window "ADOBEC": has A, B, C (valid) ‚úì
- Try to contract from left

Step 3: Contract window
- Remove "A": "DOBEC" (invalid, missing A)
- Can't contract more

Step 4: Continue expanding
- Window "ADOBECODEBANC": still valid
- Contract: "ODEBANC" (invalid)
- Continue...

Step 5: Find minimum
- Smallest valid window: "BANC"

Output: "BANC"
```

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty `s` or `t`: Return empty string
- `t` longer than `s`: Return empty string
- No valid window exists: Return empty string
- Entire `s` is the minimum window: Return `s`
- Multiple minimum windows: Return any one (first found)

<details>
<summary><b>üí° APPROACH</b></summary>

The approach uses the sliding window technique with two pointers and frequency maps.

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Build frequency map for target string `t`
2. Initialize two pointers (left, right) and tracking variables
3. Expand window by moving right pointer:
   - Add character to window
   - If character frequency matches target, increment "formed" counter
4. When window is valid (formed == required):
   - Try to contract by moving left pointer
   - Update minimum window if current is smaller
5. Return the minimum window substring

### Key Variables:
- `target_count`: Frequency map of characters in `t`
- `window_counts`: Frequency map of characters in current window
- `required`: Number of unique characters in `t` that must be in window
- `formed`: Number of unique characters in window with desired frequency
