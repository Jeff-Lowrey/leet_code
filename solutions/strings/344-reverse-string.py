# 344. Reverse String
# Difficulty: Easy
This problem demonstrates key concepts in Strings.

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
The problem asks us to reverse a string (represented as a list of characters) in-place, meaning we
must modify the original array without using extra space for another array. The most intuitive
approach is to use two pointers - one at the start and one at the end - and swap elements as we
move towards the center.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize two pointers**: One at the start (left) and one at the end (right)
2. **Swap and move**: While left < right, swap elements at left and right positions
3. **Increment/Decrement**: Move left pointer forward and right pointer backward
4. **Continue until pointers meet**: When left >= right, all elements have been swapped

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- By swapping elements from both ends moving towards the center, we reverse the array
- Each element is only touched once, making it efficient
- No additional space is needed beyond the two pointer variables
- The algorithm naturally handles both odd and even length arrays

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
We iterate through half the array (n/2 swaps), which is O(n).

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)
Only two pointer variables are used, regardless of input size.

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Step 1: Swap positions 0 and 4: ["o","e","l","l","h"]
Step 2: Swap positions 1 and 3: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Step 3: Position 2 is the center, done
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty array: No swaps needed
- Single element: No swaps needed
- Two elements: Single swap
- Array already reversed: Still performs swaps (idempotent)

<summary><b>üí° APPROACH</b></summary>

The approach uses the two-pointer technique, a fundamental pattern in array manipulation.

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Initialize left pointer at index 0
2. Initialize right pointer at index len(s) - 1
3. While left < right:
   - Swap s[left] and s[right]
   - Increment left
   - Decrement right
4. Array is now reversed in-place
