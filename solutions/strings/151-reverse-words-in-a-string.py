# 151. Reverse Words In A String

This problem demonstrates key concepts in String manipulation and parsing.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>"  hello   world  "</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"world hello"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>After reversing words, 'the sky is blue' becomes 'blue is sky the'</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
We need to reverse the order of words in a string, where words are separated by spaces. The key
challenges are: 1) handling multiple spaces between words, 2) trimming leading/trailing spaces,
and 3) reversing the word order while preserving word integrity.

### APPROACH:
1. **Strip leading/trailing spaces**: Remove any whitespace from both ends
2. **Split by whitespace**: Use regex or Python's split() to handle multiple spaces
3. **Reverse the list of words**: Reverse the order of words
4. **Join with single space**: Combine words back with exactly one space between them

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Python's split() without arguments automatically handles multiple spaces
- It splits on any whitespace and removes empty strings from the result
- Reversing a list in Python is O(n) and very efficient
- Joining with a single space ensures proper formatting

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: s = "  hello   world  "
Step 1: Strip: "hello   world"
Step 2: Split: ["hello", "world"]
Step 3: Reverse: ["world", "hello"]
Step 4: Join: "world hello"
Output: "world hello"

Input: s = "a good   example"
Step 1: Strip: "a good   example"
Step 2: Split: ["a", "good", "example"]
Step 3: Reverse: ["example", "good", "a"]
Step 4: Join: "example good a"
Output: "example good a"
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)
Where n is the length of the string. We scan the string once to split, reverse the list (O(n)),
and join back (O(n)).

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(n)
We create a list of words and the result string, both proportional to input size.

### EDGE CASES:
- Single word: Returns the same word
- Empty string: Returns empty string
- Only spaces: Returns empty string
- Multiple consecutive spaces: Handled by split()
- Leading/trailing spaces: Removed by strip() or split()
