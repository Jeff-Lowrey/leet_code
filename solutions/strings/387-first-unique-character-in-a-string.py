# 387. First Unique Character In A String
**Easy**

This problem demonstrates key concepts in Hash Tables and String manipulation.

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
To find the first unique (non-repeating) character in a string, we need to know the frequency
of each character. A character is unique if it appears exactly once. We need to return the index
of the first such character when reading left to right.

### APPROACH:
1. **Count frequencies**: Build a frequency map of all characters in the string
2. **Find first unique**: Iterate through string again, checking frequency map
3. **Return index**: Return the index of first character with frequency 1
4. **Return -1**: If no unique character exists

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Two-pass approach: first pass counts, second pass finds
- Hash map provides O(1) lookup for character frequencies
- By iterating left to right in second pass, we find the first unique character
- This approach is more efficient than checking each character's uniqueness separately

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
We make two passes through the string: one to count (O(n)) and one to find (O(n)).
Total is O(2n) = O(n).

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)
Although we use a hash map, since we're limited to lowercase English letters (26 characters),
the space is bounded by a constant. For general character sets, it would be O(k) where k is
the character set size.

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Step 1: Count frequencies: {'l':1, 'e':3, 't':1, 'c':1, 'o':1, 'd':1}
Step 2: Check s[0]='l': frequency is 1, found first unique!
Output: 0

Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Step 1: Count frequencies: {'l':2, 'o':2, 'v':1, 'e':4, 't':1, 'c':1, 'd':1}
Step 2: Check s[0]='l': frequency is 2, not unique
Step 3: Check s[1]='o': frequency is 2, not unique
Step 4: Check s[2]='v': frequency is 1, found first unique!
Output: 2
```

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty string: Return -1
- Single character: Return 0
- No unique characters (all repeated): Return -1
- All unique characters: Return 0 (first character)
- String with only one unique character at the end: Return its index

<summary><b>üí° APPROACH</b></summary>

The approach uses the Counter from collections module for efficient frequency counting.

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Import Counter from collections
2. Count all character frequencies in one pass
3. Iterate through string indices
4. For each character, check if its frequency is 1
5. Return the index of the first character with frequency 1
6. If no such character exists, return -1

### Alternative Approaches:
- Use regular dict instead of Counter (slightly more code)
- Single pass with ordered dict (track order while counting)
- indexOf + lastIndexOf comparison (less efficient)
