# 227. Basic Calculator Ii

Given a string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value.

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-2^31, 2^31 - 1].

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>"3+2*2"</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>7</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Expression '3+2*2' evaluates to 7</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Use stack to handle operators. Scan number by number. For +/- push to stack. For *// pop, compute with previous, push result. Finally sum stack for result.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize variables**: Set stack = [], num = 0, sign = '+'
2. **Iterate through string**: For i, char in enumerate(s)
3. **Build number**: If char.isdigit(), num = num * 10 + int(char)
4. **Process operator**: If char in '+-*/' or last character
5. **Handle signs**: If sign == '+', push num; if '-', push -num; if '*', push stack.pop() * num; if '/', push int(stack.pop() / num)
6. **Update sign**: Set sign = char, reset num = 0
7. **Sum stack**: Return sum(stack) as final result

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Stack handles operator precedence: */ evaluated immediately, +- pushed to stack
- Track last operator, current number being built
- When + or -, push to stack (signed number)
- When * or /, pop and compute with current number, push result
- Sum stack at end for final result
- O(n) time: single pass, O(n) space for stack

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: s = "3+2*2"
Step 1: Parse and evaluate
  num=3, op='+', stack=[3]
  num=2, op='*', stack=[3,2]
  num=2, op=None, stack=[3,4] (multiply 2*2)

Step 2: Sum stack
  result = 3+4 = 7

Output: 7
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
