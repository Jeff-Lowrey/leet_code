# 150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression
in Reverse Polish Notation.

Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

Note that:
- The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
- Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
- The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
- There will not be any division by zero.
- The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in reverse polish notation.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>["2","1","+","3","*"]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>9</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Postfix '2 1 + 3 *' evaluates to 9</dd>
</dl>

### INTUITION:
Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is perfect for stack-based evaluation. In RPN,
operators come after their operands, so we can process left-to-right:
push numbers onto stack, and when we see an operator, pop two operands,
compute, and push result back.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize stack**: Empty stack to store operands
2. **Process tokens**: Iterate through each token
3. **Handle numbers**: Push numbers onto stack
4. **Handle operators**: Pop two operands, compute, push result
5. **Return result**: Final stack should have one element (the answer)

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- RPN guarantees operators have their operands available on stack
- Stack's LIFO property matches RPN's evaluation order
- Each operator consumes exactly two operands and produces one result

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: ["2","1","+","3","*"]
Stack operations:
"2" -> [2]
"1" -> [2,1]
"+" -> [3]        (pop 1,2; compute 2+1=3; push 3)
"3" -> [3,3]
"*" -> [9]        (pop 3,3; compute 3*3=9; push 9)
Output: 9
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)
Where n is the number of tokens - process each token once

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(n)
Stack can hold up to n/2 operands in worst case

### EDGE CASES:
- Single number: return that number
- Division truncating toward zero
- Negative operands and results
