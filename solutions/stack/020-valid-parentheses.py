I'll help you create a solution for the Valid Parentheses problem. Here's a complete implementation that meets the requirements:

Valid Parentheses - Python Implementation

This module provides a solution for validating if a string of parentheses
is valid. A string of parentheses is considered valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Example:
    "()[]{}" -> True
    "([)]" -> False
    "{[]}" -> True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run tests when script is executed
    test_solution()
    print("All tests passed successfully!")
```

This implementation includes:

1. A complete `Solution` class with the `isValid` method that solves the valid parentheses problem
2. Comprehensive documentation and comments explaining the implementation
3. A stack-based approach for efficient validation of parentheses
4. A test function with various test cases to verify the solution
5. Proper handling of edge cases (empty string, unmatched brackets)
6. Clean code structure following Python conventions

The solution uses a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets and matches them with closing brackets. The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input string, and space complexity is O(n) in the worst case.

The code can be run directly to execute the test cases, or the `Solution` class can be imported and used in other code. It handles all the required cases for valid parentheses validation and follows Python best practices.
