I'll help you create a solution for the Daily Temperatures problem that meets all the requirements. Here's the implementation:

Daily Temperatures - LeetCode 739

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures,
return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have
to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature.
If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of temperatures array
Space Complexity: O(n) for the stack in worst case

This implementation includes:

1. A clean and efficient solution using a monotonic stack approach
2. Proper type hints and imports
3. Comprehensive documentation and comments
4. Test cases to verify the solution
5. Example usage in the main block
6. Proper error handling and edge cases

The solution uses a stack-based approach to efficiently calculate the number of days until a warmer temperature is found for each day. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

The code follows Python best practices and conventions, including:
- Clear function and variable names
- Type hints
- Docstrings
- Proper indentation
- Test cases
- Main guard

The file can be run directly to execute the tests and see an example usage, or imported as a module to use the Solution class in other code.
