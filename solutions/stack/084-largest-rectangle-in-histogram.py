This implementation includes:

1. A `Solution` class with the main algorithm implementation
2. A stack-based approach for efficient calculation of the largest rectangle
3. Comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios
4. Clear comments explaining the logic and implementation details
5. Type hints for better code readability
6. Proper error handling for edge cases
7. A test function to verify the implementation
8. Example usage demonstration

The algorithm uses a stack-based approach to efficiently calculate the largest rectangle area:
- It maintains a stack of indices of histogram bars
- For each bar, it processes the stack to calculate potential rectangles
- It handles edge cases like empty input and single-element histograms
- Time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of bars
- Space complexity is O(n) for the stack

The code follows Python best practices and conventions, including:
- Clear variable names
- Proper docstrings
- Type hints
- Consistent formatting
- Modular structure
- Test cases
- Main guard for execution
