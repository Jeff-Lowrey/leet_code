# 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String
# Difficulty: Easy
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. A duplicate removal
consists of choosing two adjacent and equal characters and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It can be
proven that the answer is unique.

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Use a stack to efficiently track characters. When we see a character that matches
the top of the stack, we've found an adjacent duplicate pair - pop the stack.
Otherwise, push the character onto the stack.

### APPROACH:
1. Use stack to track characters we've seen
2. For each character:
   - If it matches stack top: pop (remove duplicate pair)
   - Otherwise: push character onto stack
3. Join stack elements to form final string

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Stack naturally maintains adjacency (top element is most recent)
- Removing duplicates as we go handles cascading removals
- Single pass is sufficient since we process left-to-right

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
Single pass through string with O(1) stack operations

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n)
Stack stores up to n characters in worst case (no duplicates)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty string: returns empty string
- No duplicates: returns original string
- All characters form duplicate pairs: returns empty string
- Cascading removals: "abccba" ‚Üí "abba" ‚Üí "aa" ‚Üí ""
