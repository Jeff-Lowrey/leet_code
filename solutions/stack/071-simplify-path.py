Simplify Path - Python Implementation

This module provides a solution to simplify Unix-style file paths.
It handles various edge cases and follows canonical path rules.

Example:
    Input: "/home//foo/"
    Output: "/home/foo"

class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:

        Returns:
            str: The simplified canonical path
            
        Examples:
            >>> solution = Solution()
            >>> solution.simplifyPath("/home//foo/")
            "/home/foo"
            >>> solution.simplifyPath("/a/./b/../../c/")

    print(f"Original path: {example_path}")
    print(f"Simplified path: {simplified}")
```

This implementation includes:

1. A well-structured `Solution` class with the main `simplifyPath` method
2. Comprehensive documentation with docstrings
3. A test function with various test cases
4. Clear comments explaining the logic
5. Proper handling of edge cases
6. Example usage in the main block

The solution handles all the common cases in Unix-style paths:
- Multiple consecutive slashes ("//")
- Current directory (".")
- Parent directory ("..")
- Empty components
- Root directory special cases

The algorithm uses a stack-based approach to keep track of valid path components and handles parent directory navigation efficiently. The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input path, and space complexity is O(n) for storing the components.

The code follows Python best practices and PEP 8 style guidelines, making it clean and maintainable.
