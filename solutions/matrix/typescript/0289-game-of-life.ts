/**
### INTUITION:
The key insight is that the challenge is applying rules simultaneously to all cells. Use state encoding to track both current and next states in-place, avoiding extra space while ensuring all decisions are based on the original state.

### APPROACH:
1. **State Encoding**: Use 4 states instead of 2
   - 0: dead → dead
   - 1: live → live
   - 2: live → dead (dying)
   - 3: dead → live (born)
2. **Two Passes**: First pass marks transitions, second pass finalizes states
3. **Neighbor Counting**: Count neighbors considering only original states (0,1 and 2 were originally live)

### WHY THIS WORKS:
The encoding preserves original state information while tracking transitions. During neighbor counting, we can distinguish original live cells (1 or 2) from original dead cells (0 or 3), ensuring correct rule application.

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
Input:
```
[[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
```

Steps (showing 4 generations with rule application):

Step 1: Initial → Generation 1
  Applying rules to each cell (showing all 8 neighbors):
  - [0,1]=1 has neighbors [0,0]=0, [0,2]=0, [1,0]=0, [1,1]=0, [1,2]=1 → 1 live → dies (underpopulation)
  - [1,2]=1 has neighbors [0,1]=1, [0,2]=0, [1,1]=0, [2,1]=1, [2,2]=1 → 3 live → survives (2-3 neighbors)
  - [2,0]=1 has neighbors [1,0]=0, [1,1]=0, [2,1]=1, [3,0]=0, [3,1]=0 → 1 live → dies (underpopulation)
  - [2,1]=1 has neighbors [1,0]=0, [1,1]=0, [1,2]=1, [2,0]=1, [2,2]=1, [3,0]=0, [3,1]=0, [3,2]=0 → 3 live → survives (2-3 neighbors)
  - [2,2]=1 has neighbors [1,1]=0, [1,2]=1, [2,1]=1, [3,1]=0, [3,2]=0 → 2 live → survives (2-3 neighbors)
  - [1,0]=0 has neighbors [0,0]=0, [0,1]=1, [1,1]=0, [2,0]=1, [2,1]=1 → 3 live → becomes alive (reproduction)
  - [1,1]=0 has neighbors [0,0]=0, [0,1]=1, [0,2]=0, [1,0]=0, [1,2]=1, [2,0]=1, [2,1]=1, [2,2]=1 → 5 live → stays dead (not exactly 3)
  - [3,1]=0 has neighbors [2,0]=1, [2,1]=1, [2,2]=1, [3,0]=0, [3,2]=0 → 3 live → becomes alive (reproduction)
  Result: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]

Step 2: Generation 1 → Generation 2
  Pattern stabilizing, fewer changes
  Result: [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]

Step 3: Generation 2 → Generation 3
  Pattern reached stable state (no changes)
  Result: [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]

Step 4: Generation 3 → Generation 4
  Pattern remains stable
  Result: [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]

Output (after 4 generations):
```
[[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(m × n)**

- Based on input size and operations

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)**
- Constant extra space

### EDGE CASES:
- **All dead cells**: Remain dead if no neighbors
- **All live cells**: Most die from overcrowding
- **Single live cell**: Dies (insufficient neighbors)
- **Stable patterns**: Some configurations don't change
- **In-place update**: Use encoding to track current and next state
