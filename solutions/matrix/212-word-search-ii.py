212. Word Search II
Hard

Given an m x n board of characters and a list of strings words, return all words on the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are
horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
This is an extension of Word Search I, but instead of searching for one word, we need to find
multiple words efficiently. A Trie (prefix tree) is perfect for this as it allows us to search
for multiple words simultaneously and prune paths early when no word has a given prefix.

### APPROACH:
1. **Build Trie**: Insert all words into a Trie data structure
2. **DFS with Trie traversal**:
   - Start DFS from each cell
   - Traverse both the board and Trie simultaneously
   - When we reach a word end in Trie, add it to results
   - Prune branches when current path can't lead to any word
3. **Optimization**: Remove found words from Trie to avoid duplicates

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Trie allows efficient prefix checking and multiple word search
- DFS explores all paths while Trie guides the search
- Early pruning improves performance significantly
- Removing found words prevents duplicate results

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Board: [["o","a","a","n"],
        ["e","t","a","e"],
        ["i","h","k","r"],
        ["i","f","l","v"]]
Words: ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]

Build Trie with all words, then DFS from each cell:
- From (0,0) 'o': o‚Üía‚Üít‚Üíh ‚úì "oath" found
- From (1,1) 't': no valid words start with 't' at this position
- From (1,0) 'e': e‚Üía‚Üít ‚úì "eat" found
- etc.

Result: ["oath", "eat"]
```

### COMPLEXITY:
- Time: O(m*n*4^L*W) where L is max word length, W is number of words
- Space: O(W*L) for Trie storage
