79. Word Search

Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are
horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
We need to find a path in the grid that spells out the target word. This is a classic backtracking
problem where we explore all possible paths from each starting position.

### APPROACH:
1. **Try each cell as starting point**: For each cell, start DFS if it matches first character
2. **DFS with backtracking**:
   - Mark current cell as visited (modify in-place)
   - Try all 4 directions (up, down, left, right)
   - If we reach the end of word, return True
   - Backtrack by unmarking the cell
3. **Base cases**:
   - If we've matched entire word, return True
   - If out of bounds or character doesn't match, return False

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- DFS explores all possible paths from each starting position
- Backtracking ensures we don't reuse cells in the same path
- In-place modification avoids extra space for visited tracking

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Board: [["A","B","C","E"],
        ["S","F","C","S"],
        ["A","D","E","E"]]
Word: "ABCCED"

Start at (0,0) 'A':
A(0,0) ‚Üí B(0,1) ‚Üí C(0,2) ‚Üí C(1,2) ‚Üí E(2,2) ‚Üí D(2,1) ‚úì

Path found: A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC‚ÜíC‚ÜíE‚ÜíD matches "ABCCED"
```

### COMPLEXITY:
- Time: O(m*n*4^L) where L is word length - DFS from each cell
- Space: O(L) - recursion depth for word length
