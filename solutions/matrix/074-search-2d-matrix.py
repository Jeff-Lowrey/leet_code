74. Search a 2D Matrix
Medium

You are given an m x `n` integer `matrix` with the following two properties:
- Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, return true if `target` is in `matrix` or false otherwise.

You must write a solution in O(log(`m` * n)) time complexity.

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Since the matrix is sorted both `row-wise` and the first element of each row is greater than
the last element of the previous row, we can treat the entire `matrix` as a single sorted array.
We can use binary search to find the target efficiently.

### APPROACH:
1. **Treat `matrix` as 1D array**: Map 2D indices to 1D and vice versa
2. **Binary search**: Use standard binary search on the "flattened" matrix
3. **Index conversion**:
   - 1D index `i` maps to matrix[i // n][i % n]
   - Where n is the number of columns

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- The matrix properties guarantee it's equivalent to a sorted 1D array
- Binary search gives us O(log(m*n)) time complexity
- Index mapping allows us to work with 2D matrix using 1D logic

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Matrix: [[1,4,7,11,15],
         [2,5,8,12,19],
         [3,6,9,16,22],
         [10,13,14,17,24],
         [18,21,23,26,30]]

As 1D: [1,4,7,11,15,2,5,8,12,19,3,6,9,16,22,10,13,14,17,24,18,21,23,26,30]
Wait, this is wrong! The matrix should be `row-sorted` AND each row starts > `previous` row ends.

Correct example:
Matrix: [[1,3,5,7],
         [10,11,16,20],
         [23,30,34,60]]

As 1D: [1,3,5,7,10,11,16,20,23,30,34,60] - fully sorted!
Target 11: Binary search finds it at index 5 ‚Üí matrix[1][1]
```

### COMPLEXITY:
- Time: O(log(m*n)) - binary search on m*n elements
- Space: O(1) - only using pointers
