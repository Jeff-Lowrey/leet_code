37. Sudoku Solver
Hard

Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:
1. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.

The '.' character indicates empty cells.

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
This is a classic backtracking problem. We need to try placing digits 1-9 in empty cells
and validate if the placement is valid according to Sudoku rules. If we reach a dead end,
we backtrack and try the next possibility.

### APPROACH:
1. **Find empty cell**: Look for next '.' in the board
2. **Try digits 1-9**: For each digit, check if placement is valid
3. **Validate placement**: Check row, column, and 3x3 box constraints
4. **Recursive solve**: If valid, place digit and recursively solve remaining
5. **Backtrack**: If no solution found, remove digit and try next

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Backtracking explores all possible valid combinations
- Early validation prevents invalid paths from being explored deeply
- Systematic approach ensures we find a solution if one exists

### VALIDATION RULES:
- **Row**: Digit must not appear elsewhere in same row
- **Column**: Digit must not appear elsewhere in same column
- **3x3 Box**: Digit must not appear elsewhere in same 3x3 sub-grid

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input board with '.' for empty cells:
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
 ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
 [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
 ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
 ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
 ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
 [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
 [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]

Algorithm tries each empty cell systematically, validating each placement.
```

### COMPLEXITY:
- Time: O(9^(n*n)) where n=9 - worst case tries all combinations
- Space: O(n*n) - recursion depth for board size
