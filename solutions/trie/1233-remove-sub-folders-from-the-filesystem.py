# 1233. Remove Sub Folders From The Filesystem
**Medium**

Given a list of folders, remove all sub-folders in those folders and return the folders in any order.

If a folder[i] is located within another folder[j], it is called a sub-folder of it.

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: '/' followed by one or more lowercase English letters.

For example, "/leetcode" and "/leetcode/problems" are valid paths while an empty string and "/" are not.

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
We need to identify and remove sub-folders from a list of folder paths. A sub-folder is any folder that has another folder as its prefix path. Using a Trie allows us to efficiently detect prefix relationships by building a tree structure where each node represents a path component.

### APPROACH:
1. **Sort paths**: Sort lexicographically to process parent folders before their children
2. **Use Trie structure**: Build a trie where each node represents a folder name
3. **Mark folder ends**: Use a flag to mark where complete folders end
4. **Detect sub-folders**: If we reach a node marked as folder end, any path continuing from there is a sub-folder
5. **Collect results**: Only add paths that aren't sub-folders of previously added paths

Alternative: Sort paths and check if each path starts with previous path + '/'

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Sorting ensures parent folders come before children
- Trie naturally represents hierarchical structure
- Marking folder ends distinguishes complete folders from intermediate path components
- When we encounter a folder end marker, we know any continuation is a sub-folder

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(N * L * log(N))
Where N is number of folders and L is average path length
- Sorting: O(N * L * log(N))
- Trie operations: O(N * L)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(N * L)
For storing the trie structure

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: ["/a", "/a/b", "/c/d", "/c/d/e", "/c/f"]

After sorting: ["/a", "/a/b", "/c/d", "/c/d/e", "/c/f"]

Process "/a":
  root -> 'a' (mark as folder end)
  Result: ["/a"]

Process "/a/b":
  root -> 'a' (already folder end, skip!)

Process "/c/d":
  root -> 'c' -> 'd' (mark as folder end)
  Result: ["/a", "/c/d"]

Process "/c/d/e":
  root -> 'c' -> 'd' (already folder end, skip!)

Process "/c/f":
  root -> 'c' -> 'f' (mark as folder end)
  Result: ["/a", "/c/d", "/c/f"]
```

### EDGE CASES:
- Single folder
- No sub-folders
- All folders are sub-folders of one root
- Folders with similar prefixes but different paths
