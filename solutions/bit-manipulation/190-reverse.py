Reverse Bits - Python Implementation

This module provides a solution for reversing bits of a given 32-bit unsigned integer.
The solution includes both a straightforward approach and an optimized approach.

Example:
    Input:  n = 43261596 (represented in binary as 00000010100101000001111010011100)
    Output: 964176192 (represented in binary as 00111001011110000010100101000000)

This implementation provides:

1. A clean, well-structured solution with two different approaches:
   - A straightforward bit-by-bit reversal method
   - An optimized version using bit manipulation tricks

2. Comprehensive documentation including:
   - Module docstring explaining the purpose
   - Method docstrings with Args and Returns sections
   - Time and space complexity analysis
   - Comments explaining the logic

3. A test function to verify the implementation with various test cases

4. Proper Python conventions and best practices:
   - Clear variable names
   - Consistent formatting
   - Type hints
   - Modular structure

5. Edge case handling:
   - Zero
   - Single bit numbers
   - Large numbers
   - Numbers with highest bit set

The code can be run directly to test the implementation, and both methods (regular and optimized) will produce the same correct results for all test cases.
