# 190. Reverse Bits

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

Note:
- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>n = 00000010100101000001111010011100 (43261596)</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Bits of 00000010100101000001111010011100 are reversed to 00111001011110000010100101000000</dd>

### INTUITION:
Reverse bits by extracting each bit from the right (n & 1), shifting result left, and adding the bit. Process all 32 bits by shifting n right each iteration.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize result**: Set result = 0 to build the reversed bits
2. **Loop 32 times**: Iterate for each of the 32 bits in the integer
3. **Extract rightmost bit**: Use (n & 1) to get the current rightmost bit of n
4. **Shift result left**: Left-shift result by 1 to make room for the new bit (result <<= 1)
5. **Add bit to result**: Use result |= (n & 1) to add the extracted bit to result
6. **Shift n right**: Right-shift n by 1 to process the next bit (n >>= 1)
7. **Return result**: After 32 iterations, return result with all bits reversed

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Process 32 bits: shift result left, add rightmost bit of n, shift n right
- result = (result << 1) | (n & 1), then n >>= 1
- Each iteration moves one bit from n to result in reverse position
- Repeat 32 times for all bits
- O(1) time: fixed 32 iterations, O(1) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100 (43261596)
Step 1: Reverse bits one by one
  result = 0, iterate 32 times:
  Bit 0: n & 1 = 0, result = 0
  Bit 1: n & 1 = 0, result = 0
  ...
  Bit 31: n & 1 = 0, result = 964176192

Step 2: Detailed process for first few bits
  n = 43261596, result = 0
  - Extract bit 0 (0), shift result left, add bit
  - Extract bit 1 (0), shift result left, add bit
  - Continue for all 32 bits

Output: 964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
