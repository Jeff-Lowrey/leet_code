# 338. Counting Bits

Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[0,1,1,2,1,2]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"Expected {expected}, got {result}"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Counting bits: for n=5, result is [0,1,1,2,1,2] (bit counts for 0-5)</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
For each number, count set bits. Pattern: dp[i] = dp[i >> 1] + (i & 1). The count for i equals count for i/2 plus the last bit of i.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize result array**: Create result = [0] * (n + 1) to store counts for 0 to n
2. **Iterate from 1 to n**: Loop with index i from 1 to n
3. **Use recurrence relation**: Set result[i] = result[i >> 1] + (i & 1)
4. **Understand i >> 1**: Right shift removes the rightmost bit, giving count for i//2
5. **Add rightmost bit**: (i & 1) adds 1 if rightmost bit is set, 0 otherwise
6. **Build incrementally**: Each result[i] uses previously computed result[i//2]
7. **Return result**: Return complete result array with counts for all numbers 0 to n

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- DP: count[i] = count[i >> 1] + (i & 1)
- Bit shift right removes last bit, i & 1 checks if last bit is 1
- Reuse previous results: i >> 1 is already computed
- Alternatively: count[i] = count[i & (i-1)] + 1 (remove rightmost 1)
- O(n) time: each number processed once, O(1) space excluding output

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: n = 5
Step 1: Count bits for each number from 0 to 5
  0 = 000 ‚Üí 0 bits
  1 = 001 ‚Üí 1 bit
  2 = 010 ‚Üí 1 bit
  3 = 011 ‚Üí 2 bits
  4 = 100 ‚Üí 1 bit
  5 = 101 ‚Üí 2 bits

Step 2: DP relation: count[i] = count[i>>1] + (i&1)
  count[0] = 0
  count[1] = count[0] + 1 = 1
  count[2] = count[1] + 0 = 1
  count[3] = count[1] + 1 = 2
  count[4] = count[2] + 0 = 1
  count[5] = count[2] + 1 = 2

Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
