<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
[This problem requires understanding of bit manipulation concepts. The key insight is to identify the optimal approach for this specific scenario.]

### APPROACH:
1. **Analyze the problem**: Understand the input constraints and expected output
2. **Choose the right technique**: Apply bit manipulation methodology

class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        """
        Returns an array where ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary
        representation of i.

        The solution uses dynamic programming with the observation that:
        For any number x, countBits(x) = countBits(x/2) + (x % 2)

        Args:
            n (int): The upper bound number (inclusive)

        Returns:
            List[int]: Array containing count of 1's for each number from 0 to n

        Example:
            >>> solution = Solution()
            >>> solution.countBits(5)
            [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]
