191. Number of 1 Bits
Easy

Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns
the number of set bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Example:
Input: n = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 1011 has three set bits.

### INTUITION:
Use bit manipulation to count 1s. The key insight is `n & (n-1)` removes the rightmost
set bit, allowing us to count iterations until n becomes 0.

### APPROACH:
1. **Brian Kernighan's Algorithm**: n & (n-1) flips rightmost 1-bit to 0
2. **Count iterations**: Each operation removes one 1-bit
3. **Terminate**: When n becomes 0, all 1-bits have been counted

### WHY THIS WORKS:
n-1 flips all bits after the rightmost 1 (including the 1 itself).
AND-ing with n keeps only the bits that were 1 in both, effectively removing that rightmost 1.

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(k) where k is number of 1-bits
### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
n = 11 (binary: 1011)
Count = 0

Iteration 1: n = 1011, n-1 = 1010
n & (n-1) = 1010, count = 1

Iteration 2: n = 1010, n-1 = 1001
n & (n-1) = 1000, count = 2

Iteration 3: n = 1000, n-1 = 0111
n & (n-1) = 0000, count = 3

Result: 3
```

### ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
1. **Check each bit**: Loop 32 times, check (n >> i) & 1
2. **Built-in**: Use bin(n).count('1') in Python
3. **Lookup table**: Precompute counts for all bytes
