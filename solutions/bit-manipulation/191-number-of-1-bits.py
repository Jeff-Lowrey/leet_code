191. Number of 1 Bits
Easy

Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and
returns the number of `set` bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Example:
Input: `n` = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary representation of 11 is 1011 which has 3 `set` bits.

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Count the number of set bits (1s) in a binary number. The key insight is using Brian Kernighan's algorithm: n & (n-1) removes the rightmost set bit in O(1) time.

### APPROACH (Brian Kernighan's Algorithm):
1. **While n is not zero**, perform n = n & (n-1) and increment counter
2. **n & (n-1)** flips the rightmost set bit to 0
3. **Continue until n becomes 0** (no more set bits)

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- n & (n-1) removes exactly one set bit (the rightmost one) each iteration
- We only iterate as many times as there are set bits
- Much more efficient than checking every bit position

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(number of set bits) - best case O(1), worst case O(32)
### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)

### THREE APPROACHES:

#### Approach 1: Brian Kernighan's (Optimal)
```python
while n:
    n &= n - 1  # Remove rightmost set bit
    count += 1
```

#### Approach 2: Bit Shifting
```python
while n:
    count += n & 1  # Check last bit
    n >>= 1         # Shift right
```

#### Approach 3: Built-in Function
```python
return bin(n).count('1')
```

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH (Brian Kernighan's):
```
Input: n = 11 (binary: 1011)

Iteration 1:
n = 11 (1011)
n-1 = 10 (1010)
n & (n-1) = 1011 & 1010 = 1010 (removed rightmost 1)
count = 1

Iteration 2:
n = 10 (1010)
n-1 = 9 (1001)
n & (n-1) = 1010 & 1001 = 1000 (removed rightmost 1)
count = 2

Iteration 3:
n = 8 (1000)
n-1 = 7 (0111)
n & (n-1) = 1000 & 0111 = 0000 (removed last 1)
count = 3

n = 0, exit loop
Result: 3
```

### KEY INSIGHT:
Brian Kernighan's algorithm is optimal because it only iterates once per set bit, making it faster for sparse binary numbers (numbers with few 1s).
