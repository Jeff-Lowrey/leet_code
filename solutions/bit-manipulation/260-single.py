# Difficulty: Medium

# 260. Single Number III

Given an integer array nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in any order.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses only constant extra space.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[3, 5]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"Expected {expected}, got {result}"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Two numbers [3,5] appear once in [1,2,1,3,2,5]</dd>
</dl>

### INTUITION:
XOR all numbers - pairs cancel leaving x^y. Find any set bit in x^y to distinguish them. Partition numbers by this bit and XOR each partition separately to get x and y.

### APPROACH:
1. **XOR all numbers**: Compute xor_all = 0, then xor_all ^= num for each num (pairs cancel, leaving two singles XORed)
2. **Find differentiating bit**: Find rightmost set bit in xor_all using rightmost_bit = xor_all & (-xor_all)
3. **Partition into groups**: This bit is 1 in one single number and 0 in the other
4. **Initialize two results**: Set num1 = 0, num2 = 0 to accumulate XORs for each group
5. **Separate by bit**: For each num, if (num & rightmost_bit), add to num1 group, else num2 group
6. **XOR within groups**: XOR all numbers in each group separately (pairs cancel within groups)
7. **Return both singles**: Return [num1, num2] as the two numbers appearing once

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- XOR all numbers: duplicates cancel, left with xor = a ^ b
- Find any set bit in xor (rightmost set bit: xor & -xor)
- Split numbers into two groups by this bit (one has a, other has b)
- XOR each group separately to find a and b
- O(n) time: two passes, O(1) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Step 1: XOR all numbers
  xor = 1^2^1^3^2^5 = 3^5 = 6 (binary: 110)

Step 2: Find rightmost set bit
  rightmost_bit = xor & -xor = 110 & 010 = 010 (bit 1)

Step 3: Partition numbers by rightmost bit
  Group 1 (bit 1 is 0): [1,1,5] ‚Üí XOR = 5
  Group 2 (bit 1 is 1): [2,3,2] ‚Üí XOR = 3

Output: [3, 5] (two single numbers)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
