I'll help you create a clean Python implementation for summing two integers. I'll write the solution with proper structure, comments, and error handling.

This implementation includes:

1. A proper class structure with a `getSum` method that implements the core logic
2. Detailed docstrings explaining the purpose and usage
3. A bitwise approach to adding numbers without using + or - operators
4. Proper handling of negative numbers and 32-bit integer overflow
5. A main function with test cases to demonstrate usage
6. Error checking through assertions

The solution uses bitwise operations to perform addition:
- XOR (^) to get the sum without carries
- AND (&) with left shift (<<) to get the carries
- Proper masking to handle 32-bit integers and negative numbers

The code follows Python conventions (PEP 8) and includes appropriate error handling and edge cases. It can be run directly as a script or imported as a module.

To use this solution, you can either:
1. Run it directly as a script to see the test cases
2. Import the Solution class and use it in your own code

The implementation handles positive and negative integers correctly and maintains 32-bit integer arithmetic similar to other programming languages.
