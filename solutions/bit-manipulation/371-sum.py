# 371. Sum of Two Integers

Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators + and -.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>a = 1, b = 2</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>3 (1 + 2)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Sum of 1+2 is 3 without using + or - operators</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Add two numbers without carry operator. XOR gives sum without carry, AND << 1 gives carry. Repeat until carry is 0. Handle overflow for signed integers.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize variables**: Set a and b as the two numbers to add
2. **Loop until no carry**: While b != 0, continue processing carry
3. **Calculate sum without carry**: Compute sum_without_carry = a ^ b (XOR gives sum ignoring carry)
4. **Calculate carry**: Compute carry = (a & b) << 1 (AND finds carry positions, shift left by 1)
5. **Update a and b**: Set a = sum_without_carry, b = carry for next iteration
6. **Repeat until carry is 0**: Continue loop until b becomes 0 (no more carry to propagate)
7. **Return result**: Return a which contains the final sum

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- XOR gives sum without carry, AND gives carry positions
- Repeat: sum = a ^ b, carry = (a & b) << 1
- When carry becomes 0, sum is correct
- Simulates binary addition without arithmetic operators
- O(1) time: at most 32 iterations (bit width), O(1) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Step 1: Add without carry
  sum = a ^ b = 001 ^ 010 = 011 = 3

Step 2: Calculate carry
  carry = (a & b) << 1 = (001 & 010) << 1 = 000 << 1 = 0

Step 3: Since carry = 0, done

Example with carry: a = 3, b = 5
  sum = 3 ^ 5 = 011 ^ 101 = 110 = 6
  carry = (3 & 5) << 1 = (011 & 101) << 1 = 001 << 1 = 010 = 2
  Repeat: sum = 6 ^ 2 = 110 ^ 010 = 100 = 4
  carry = (6 & 2) << 1 = (110 & 010) << 1 = 010 << 1 = 100 = 4
  Repeat: sum = 4 ^ 4 = 000 = 0, carry = (4 & 4) << 1 = 1000 = 8

Output: 3 (1 + 2)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
