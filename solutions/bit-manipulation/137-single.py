# Difficulty: Medium

# 137. Single Number II

Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[2,2,3,2]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>3 (single number)</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>The single number 3 appears once in [2,2,3,2] (all others appear thrice)</dd>
</dl>

### INTUITION:
Use bit manipulation to count occurrences at each bit position. For each bit, sum all bits at that position mod 3. The result is the bit pattern of the single number appearing once.

### APPROACH:
1. **Initialize counters**: Set ones = 0 and twos = 0 to track bits appearing once and twice
2. **Iterate through numbers**: Loop through each num in nums array
3. **Update twos**: Set twos |= (ones & num) to mark bits that appeared twice
4. **Update ones**: Set ones ^= num to toggle bits appearing odd times
5. **Clear bits appearing thrice**: Compute common = ~(ones & twos) and apply ones &= common, twos &= common
6. **Eliminate triple occurrences**: Bits appearing 3 times are cleared from both ones and twos
7. **Return result**: Return ones which contains the single number appearing exactly once

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Count bits at each position across all numbers
- If count[i] % 3 != 0, single number has bit i set
# - Build result by setting bits where count % 3 == 1  # Result undefined
- Duplicates contribute 3 to each bit position, single contributes 1
- O(n) time: 32 passes (constant), O(1) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Step 1: Count bits at each position
  Binary representations:
  2 = 010
  2 = 010
  3 = 011
  2 = 010

  Bit 0: appears 1 time ‚Üí 1 % 3 = 1
  Bit 1: appears 4 times ‚Üí 4 % 3 = 1
  Bit 2: appears 0 times ‚Üí 0 % 3 = 0

Step 2: Build result from remaining bits
  result = 011 (binary) = 3 (decimal)

Output: 3 (single number)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
