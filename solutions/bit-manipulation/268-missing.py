I'll help you create a solution for the Missing Number Bit implementation in Python. This solution will use bit manipulation to find the missing number in a sequence.

Missing Number Bit Implementation

This module implements a solution to find the missing number in a sequence
using bit manipulation (XOR operation).

The solution works by leveraging the fact that XOR of a number with itself is 0,
and XOR is commutative and associative.

This implementation provides:

1. A class `Solution` with two methods to find the missing number:
   - `missingNumber`: Uses bit manipulation (XOR)
   - `missingNumber_alternative`: Uses mathematical sum formula

2. Comprehensive documentation and comments explaining the approach

3. Test cases to verify the implementation

4. Both solutions have:
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)

5. The bit manipulation solution uses XOR properties:
   - a ⊕ a = 0
   - a ⊕ 0 = a
   - a ⊕ b = b ⊕ a (commutative)

6. The alternative solution uses the mathematical formula for sum of first n natural numbers

7. Proper error handling and edge cases are considered

To use this code, you can either:
- Run it directly to execute the test cases
- Import the Solution class and use it in your own code
- Modify the test cases or add new ones as needed

The file will be saved as `generated/BM-268-PY_missing_number_bit___python_implementation.py` and can be executed directly.
