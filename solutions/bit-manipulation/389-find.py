I'll help you create a solution for finding the difference between two strings, where one string contains an extra character. Here's a complete implementation:

Find Difference - Python Implementation

This module provides a solution to find the extra character in a string
compared to another string. The second string contains all characters from
the first string plus one additional character in any position.

Example:
    s = "abcd"
    t = "abcde"
    result = "e"

This implementation provides two different approaches to solve the problem:

1. Using XOR operation (main implementation):
   - XOR all characters in both strings
   - The result will be the extra character (since XOR of same characters cancels out)
   - Time complexity: O(n)
   - Space complexity: O(1)

2. Using character counting (alternative implementation):
   - Count frequency of characters in first string
   - Subtract frequency while checking second string
   - Return character when negative count is found
   - Time complexity: O(n)
   - Space complexity: O(1) [fixed size array]

The code includes:
- Proper documentation and comments
- Test cases to verify functionality
- Example usage
- Multiple implementation approaches
- Error handling for edge cases
- Clean code structure following Python conventions

The solution handles various edge cases and provides efficient implementations for finding the difference between two strings.
