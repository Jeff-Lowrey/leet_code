I'll help you create a Python implementation for counting the number of 1 bits in an integer. Here's the complete solution:

"""
LeetCode Problem 191: Number of 1 Bits
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits
it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Example:
    Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The input binary string has a total of three '1' bits.

This implementation includes:

1. Two different methods for counting 1 bits:
   - `hammingWeight`: Uses bitwise AND and right shift operations
   - `hammingWeight_alternative`: Uses a bit manipulation trick to clear the least significant 1 bit

2. Comprehensive documentation including:
   - Problem description
   - Function documentation with Args and Returns
   - Time and space complexity analysis

3. A test suite with various test cases including:
   - Regular positive numbers
   - Zero
   - Negative numbers (treated as unsigned)
   - Maximum 32-bit value

4. Proper Python conventions and best practices:
   - Type hints
   - Clear variable names
   - Consistent formatting
   - Modular structure

5. Error handling through assertions in the test cases

The code is complete and ready to run, with both implementations being efficient for counting 1 bits in integers. The alternative implementation using n & (n-1) is particularly efficient for sparse bit patterns as it only needs to iterate for each 1 bit present.
