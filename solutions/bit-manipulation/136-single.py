Single Number Implementation

This module provides a solution to find a single number in an array
where all other numbers appear exactly twice.

This implementation provides a solution to the Single Number problem with the following features:

1. Uses the XOR operation to find the single number efficiently
2. Includes proper type hints and documentation
3. Provides a clean, maintainable structure
4. Includes test cases in the main function
5. Follows Python conventions and best practices
6. Handles various edge cases

The solution uses the XOR operation, which has these useful properties:
- XOR of a number with itself results in 0
- XOR of a number with 0 returns the number itself
- XOR is both associative and commutative

This allows us to find the single number without using additional space, as all paired numbers will cancel out through XOR operations, leaving only the single number.

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input array, and the space complexity is O(1) as we only use a single variable regardless of input size.

To use this solution, you can either:
1. Run it directly as a script to see the test cases in action
2. Import the Solution class and use it in your own code
3. Use it as part of a larger system where you need to find single numbers in arrays

The code includes error handling implicitly through type hints and assumes valid input as per the problem constraints.
