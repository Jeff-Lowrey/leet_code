Power of Two - Python Implementation

This module provides a solution to determine if a given number is a power of 2.
A number is a power of two if it can be expressed as 2^n where n is a non-negative integer.

Examples:
    1 = 2^0 (True)
    2 = 2^1 (True)
    4 = 2^2 (True)
    5 = not a power of 2 (False)

This implementation provides:

1. A well-structured `PowerOfTwo` class with two different methods to check if a number is a power of two:
   - `is_power_of_two_bitwise`: Uses efficient bitwise operations
   - `is_power_of_two_loop`: Uses a traditional loop approach

2. Comprehensive documentation including:
   - Module docstring explaining the problem
   - Class and method docstrings with Args and Returns sections
   - Inline comments explaining key operations

3. Proper error handling for edge cases:
   - Negative numbers
   - Zero
   - Various input types

4. A main function demonstrating usage with test cases

5. Following Python best practices:
   - Type hints
   - PEP 8 style guidelines
   - Clear variable names
   - Proper organization

6. Both implementations are efficient and solve the problem in different ways:
   - The bitwise method is more efficient (O(1))
   - The loop method is more intuitive (O(log n))

The code can be run directly to see examples of powers of two being tested, or the class can be imported and used in other modules.
