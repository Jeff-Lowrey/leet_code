# 231. Power of Two

Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2^x.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[1, 2, 3, 4, 16, 17, 1024]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"Solution for 231. Power of Two:"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Number 16 is a power of 2 (16 = 2^4)</dd>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Powers of 2 have exactly one bit set. Check if n > 0 and n & (n-1) == 0. The expression n & (n-1) removes the rightmost set bit.

### APPROACH:
1. **Check if positive**: If n <= 0, return False immediately (powers of 2 are positive)
2. **Use bit manipulation trick**: Check if n & (n - 1) == 0
3. **Understand the property**: Powers of 2 have exactly one bit set (e.g., 4 = 100, 8 = 1000)
4. **Apply n-1 trick**: Subtracting 1 from power of 2 flips all bits after the single set bit
5. **Verify with AND**: n & (n-1) clears the rightmost set bit; equals 0 only for powers of 2
6. **Return result**: Return True if condition holds, False otherwise

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Power of 2 has exactly one bit set in binary
- n & (n-1) removes rightmost set bit
- If result is 0, n had only one bit set (power of 2)
- Edge case: n must be positive (negative can't be power of 2)
- O(1) time: single operation, O(1) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: n = 16
Step 1: Check if n is power of 2
  Binary: 16 = 10000 (only one bit set)
  16 - 1 = 15 = 01111 (all bits after position 4 are set)

Step 2: Apply bit trick
  16 & 15 = 10000 & 01111 = 00000 = 0
  Since result is 0, n is power of 2

Counter-example: n = 18
  Binary: 18 = 10010 (two bits set)
  18 & 17 = 10010 & 10001 = 10000 ‚â† 0

Output: True (16 is power of 2)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
