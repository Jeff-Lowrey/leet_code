Course Schedule Implementation - LeetCode 207

This module provides a solution to determine if it's possible to finish all courses
given their prerequisites. It uses a directed graph approach with cycle detection.

Problem:
There are numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1.
Some courses have prerequisites. Prerequisites are given as pairs [a, b],
which means you must take course b before course a.

Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

This implementation provides a solution to the Course Schedule problem with the following features:

1. Clear documentation and comments explaining the implementation
2. Proper type hints using the typing module
3. Efficient solution using depth-first search (DFS) for cycle detection
4. Test cases to verify the implementation
5. Proper handling of edge cases
6. Following Python conventions and best practices

The solution uses a graph-based approach where:
- Courses are represented as nodes
- Prerequisites are represented as directed edges
- A cycle in the graph means it's impossible to complete all courses
- The absence of cycles means all courses can be completed

The main algorithm uses DFS with cycle detection to determine if the course schedule is possible. It maintains two sets:
- `path`: tracks nodes in the current DFS path (for cycle detection)
- `visited`: tracks all visited nodes (for optimization)

The time complexity is O(V + E) where V is the number of courses and E is the number of prerequisites.
The space complexity is O(V + E) for storing the graph and recursion stack.
