# Difficulty: Medium

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy
(clone) of the graph.

Each `node` in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

Example:
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>[[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Graph node is cloned with all connections preserved</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
To clone a graph, we need to create new nodes and preserve the neighbor relationships.
The key challenge is handling `cycles - we` need to avoid infinite loops.

### APPROACH:
1. **Handle empty graph**: Return None immediately if input node is None
2. **Initialize hash map**: Create a dictionary to map original nodes to their clones and track visited nodes
3. **Start DFS traversal**: Begin recursive depth-first search from the given node
4. **Check if already cloned**: If current node is already in the hash map, return its clone (prevents infinite loops)
5. **Clone current node**: Create a new node with the same value and add the mapping to hash map
6. **Clone neighbors recursively**: For each neighbor of current node, recursively call DFS to get cloned neighbor
7. **Build neighbor connections**: Append each cloned neighbor to the current clone's neighbor list, preserving graph structure

### WHY THIS WORKS:
By using a hash map to track visited nodes, we ensure each node is cloned exactly once, preventing infinite loops in the presence of cycles. The DFS/BFS traversal guarantees we visit every reachable node, and by cloning neighbors recursively, we preserve the exact structure and relationships of the original graph. The hash map serves both as a visited tracker and a lookup for already-cloned nodes.

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Step 1: Start BFS from node 1
  Create clone of node 1
  visited = {1: Node(1)}

Step 2: Process neighbors of node 1 (nodes 2 and 4)
  Clone node 2, add to visited
  Clone node 4, add to visited
  Connect node 1 to nodes 2 and 4

Step 3: Process node 2 neighbors (nodes 1 and 3)
  Node 1 already cloned
  Clone node 3, connect to node 2

Step 4: Process remaining nodes
  Build all connections maintaining graph structure

Output: Cloned graph with same structure
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(V + E) - visit each node and edge once

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(V) - hash map and recursion stack

### EDGE CASES:
- **Null/empty graph**: Return None immediately
- **Single node with no neighbors**: Clone node with empty neighbor list
- **Graph with cycles**: Visited map prevents infinite loops
- **Fully connected graph**: All nodes are neighbors of each other
- **Self-loops**: Node points to itself, handled by visited check

417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow
# Difficulty: Medium
There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and
Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and
the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.

You are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents
the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring
cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is
less than or equal to the current cell's height.

Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes
that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

Example:
Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
