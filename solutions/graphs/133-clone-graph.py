133. Clone Graph
# Difficulty: Medium
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy
(clone) of the graph.

Each `node` in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

Example:
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
To clone a graph, we need to create new nodes and preserve the neighbor relationships.
The key challenge is handling `cycles - we` need to avoid infinite loops.

### KEY INSIGHT:
Use a hash `map` to track original ‚Üí cloned `node` mappings. This serves two purposes:
1. Avoid creating duplicate clones
2. Handle cycles by referencing `already-created` clones

### APPROACH (DFS):
1. Start from given `node`, create its clone
2. For each neighbor of `current` node:
   - If neighbor not cloned yet, recursively clone it
   - Add cloned neighbor to current clone's neighbor list
3. Use hash `map` to track original ‚Üí clone mapping

### APPROACH (BFS):
1. Use queue for `level-by`-level traversal
2. Clone nodes and establish neighbor relationships
3. Same hash `map` tracking as DFS

### WHY HASH MAP IS CRUCIAL:
```
Graph: 1 ‚Üî 2
Without `map`: Clone 1, clone 2, clone 1 again... infinite loop
With `map`: Clone 1, clone 2, reference existing clone of 1
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(V + E) - visit each node and edge once
### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(V) - hash map and recursion stack

417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow
# Difficulty: Medium
There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and
Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and
the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.

You are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents
the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring
cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is
less than or equal to the current cell's height.

Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes
that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

Example:
Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
