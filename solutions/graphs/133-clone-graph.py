# Difficulty: Medium

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy
(clone) of the graph.

Each `node` in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

Example:
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
To clone a graph, we need to create new nodes and preserve the neighbor relationships.
The key challenge is handling `cycles - we` need to avoid infinite loops.

### APPROACH:
[Detailed explanation of the solution approach]

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- [Explanation of correctness]

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
Input:
```
[example input]
```

**Step 1:** [description]

**Step 2:** [description]

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(V + E) - visit each node and edge once

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(V) - hash map and recursion stack

### EDGE CASES:
- **[Edge case 1]:** [how it's handled]
- **[Edge case 2]:** [how it's handled]

417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow
# Difficulty: Medium
There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and
Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and
the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.

You are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents
the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring
cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is
less than or equal to the current cell's height.

Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes
that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

Example:
Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
