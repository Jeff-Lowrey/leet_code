This implementation provides:

1. A `ConnectedComponents` class with two static methods for finding connected components:
   - `find_components_adjacency_list`: Uses an adjacency list representation
   - `find_components_adjacency_matrix`: Uses an adjacency matrix representation

2. Both methods:
   - Take the number of vertices and list of edges as input
   - Return a list of connected components
   - Use depth-first search (DFS) to explore components
   - Handle undirected graphs

3. Features:
   - Clean, well-structured code with type hints
   - Comprehensive comments explaining the implementation
   - Proper error handling and edge cases
   - Example usage in the main function
   - Both adjacency list and matrix approaches for comparison

4. The code follows Python best practices:
   - PEP 8 style guidelines
   - Type hints for better code understanding
   - Proper documentation
   - Modular design

The implementation can handle various graph sizes and configurations, and includes a main function demonstrating its usage with a sample graph.
