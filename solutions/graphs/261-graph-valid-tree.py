# 261. Graph Valid Tree

You have a graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an integer n and a list of edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return true if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and false otherwise.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[[0,1]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"Expected {expected}, got {result}"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Graph edges form a valid tree if connected and has n-1 edges</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
A valid tree has exactly n-1 edges and is fully connected with no cycles. Use Union-Find to detect cycles and count components. Valid if no cycles and all nodes in one component.

### APPROACH:
1. **Check edge count**: If edges != n-1, return False
2. **Build adjacency list**: Create graph as defaultdict(list), add edges in both directions
3. **Initialize visited set**: Create empty set to track visited nodes
4. **Define DFS function**: Implement dfs(node, parent) to traverse graph
5. **Check for cycles**: In DFS, if neighbor is visited and not parent, cycle detected
6. **Mark as visited**: Add current node to visited set, recurse on unvisited neighbors
7. **Check connectivity**: After DFS from node 0, verify len(visited) == n
8. **Return result**: Return True if no cycles and all nodes visited, else False

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Tree properties: n nodes, n-1 edges, all nodes connected, no cycles
- Check edge count == n-1 (necessary but not sufficient)
- DFS/BFS from any node: all nodes should be visited (connected)
- Union-find alternative: no cycles means each edge connects different components
- O(n + e) time: DFS/BFS, O(n) space for visited array

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,4]]
Step 1: Check edge count
  n-1 = 4 edges (necessary for tree) ‚úì

Step 2: Build adjacency list
  {0: [1,2,3], 1: [0,4], 2: [0], 3: [0], 4: [1]}

Step 3: DFS to check connectivity
  Visit 0 ‚Üí mark visited
  Visit 1 ‚Üí mark visited
  Visit 4 ‚Üí mark visited
  Visit 2 ‚Üí mark visited
  Visit 3 ‚Üí mark visited

Step 4: Verify all nodes visited
  visited = {0,1,2,3,4}, count = 5 = n ‚úì

Output: True (forms valid tree)
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
