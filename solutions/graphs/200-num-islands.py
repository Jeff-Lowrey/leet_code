200. Number of Islands
Medium

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and
'0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands
horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all
surrounded by water.

Example:
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Think of this as finding connected components in a graph. Each '1' is a node,
and adjacent '1's are connected. We need to count how many separate groups
of connected '1's exist.

### APPROACH (DFS):
1. Iterate through every cell in the grid
2. When we find a '1' (unvisited land):
   - Increment island counter
   - Start DFS to mark all connected land as visited
3. DFS explores all 4 directions and marks visited cells as '0'
4. This ensures each island is counted exactly once

### WHY DFS WORKS:
- DFS exhaustively explores all connected land from a starting point
- By marking visited cells as '0', we prevent recounting
- Each DFS call represents one complete island

### VISUALIZATION:
```
Original:    After finding first '1':    After DFS:
["1","1","0"]    ["1","1","0"]           ["0","0","0"]
["1","0","1"]    ["1","0","1"]           ["0","0","1"]
                  ^start here             islands=1
```

### ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
- **BFS**: Use queue instead of recursion stack
- **Union-Find**: Connect adjacent lands and count components
- All have similar time complexity but different space usage patterns
