# 695. Max Area Of Island

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>1</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Maximum island area is 6 square units</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
This is similar to "Number of Islands" but instead of counting islands, we need to find the largest island by area. We use DFS/BFS to explore each island and calculate its area, keeping track of the maximum area found.

### APPROACH:
1. **Iterate through grid**: Check each cell
2. **Find land**: When we find a 1 (land), start exploring the island
3. **DFS/BFS exploration**: Count all connected land cells (area)
4. **Track maximum**: Keep track of the largest area found
5. **Mark visited**: Avoid double-counting cells

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- DFS/BFS explores connected components completely
- Each exploration returns the area of that island
- We track the maximum area across all islands
- In-place marking ensures each cell is counted exactly once

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Grid: [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
       [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
       [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
       [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0]]

Islands found:
- (0,2): area = 1
- (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9): area = 4
- (2,1), (2,2), (3,1): area = 3
- (2,4), (3,4), (3,5): area = 3
- (3,8): area = 1
- (3,10): area = 1

Maximum area = 4
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(M √ó N)
We visit each cell at most once

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(M √ó N)
For recursion stack in worst case

### EDGE CASES:
- **All water**: Return 0 (no islands)
- **Single cell island**: Return 1
- **Entire grid is one island**: Return m * n
- **Multiple islands**: Return area of largest
- **Empty grid**: Return 0
