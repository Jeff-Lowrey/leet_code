# 200. Number Of Islands
# Difficulty: Medium
Given an m x n 2D binary grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
This is a classic graph traversal problem where we need to find connected components. Each island is a connected component of '1's (land). We can use DFS or BFS to explore each island completely when we encounter it, then count how many separate islands we find.

### APPROACH:
1. **Iterate through grid**: Check each cell in the grid
2. **Find land**: When we find a '1' (land), it's part of an island
3. **Explore island**: Use DFS/BFS to mark all connected land as visited
4. **Count islands**: Each time we start a new DFS/BFS, we found a new island
5. **Mark visited**: Change '1' to '0' or use separate visited array

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- DFS/BFS explores all connected components (islands) completely
- Once we've explored an island, we mark it as visited to avoid double-counting
- Each DFS/BFS start represents discovering a new island
- 4-directional connectivity defines what constitutes an island

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(M √ó N)
Where M and N are grid dimensions - we visit each cell at most once

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(M √ó N)
For recursion stack in worst case (entire grid is one island) or visited array

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Grid: [["1","1","1","1","0"],
       ["1","1","0","1","0"],
       ["1","1","0","0","0"],
       ["0","0","0","0","0"]]

Process:
- Start at (0,0): DFS explores entire connected land mass
- Mark all connected '1's as visited: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)
- Continue scanning: (1,3) is unvisited land ‚Üí start new DFS
- DFS from (1,3) only marks (1,3) as it's isolated
- Total islands found: 2
```

### KEY INSIGHTS:
- Connected components = separate islands
- In-place modification (changing '1' to '0') saves space
- DFS recursive approach is intuitive, BFS iterative approach avoids stack overflow
- Union-Find can also solve this problem efficiently

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty grid
- All water ('0's)
- All land ('1's) - single island
- Single cell grid
- Grid with no islands
