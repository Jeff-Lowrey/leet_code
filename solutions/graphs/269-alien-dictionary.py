I'll help you implement the Alien Dictionary solution in Python. This will solve the problem of determining the order of characters in an alien alphabet based on a sorted dictionary of alien words.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Solution:
    def alienOrder(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
        """
        Determines the order of characters in an alien alphabet based on a sorted dictionary of words.
        
        Args:
            words: List of strings sorted according to alien dictionary order
            
        Returns:
            String representing the order of characters in the alien alphabet.
            Returns empty string if no valid order exists.
        """
        # Edge case: empty input
        if not words:
            return ""
            
        # Initialize graph and in-degree count
        adj_list = defaultdict(set)
        in_degree = {}
        
        # Initialize in_degree for all characters
        for word in words:
            for char in word:
                in_degree[char] = 0
                
        # Build graph from adjacent words
        for i in range(len(words) - 1):
            word1, word2 = words[i], words[i + 1]
            # Check for invalid case where a prefix word is longer
            if len(word1) > len(word2) and word1[:len(word2)] == word2:
                return ""
                
            # Compare characters to build graph
            for j in range(min(len(word1), len(word2))):
                if word1[j] != word2[j]:
                    if word2[j] not in adj_list[word1[j]]:
                        adj_list[word1[j]].add(word2[j])
                        in_degree[word2[j]] += 1
                    break
                    
        # Topological sort using BFS
        queue = deque([c for c in in_degree if in_degree[c] == 0])
        result = []
        
        while queue:
            char = queue.popleft()
            result.append(char)
            
            for next_char in adj_list[char]:
                in_degree[next_char] -= 1
                if in_degree[next_char] == 0:
                    queue.append(next_char)
                    
        # Check if all characters are included
        if len(result) != len(in_degree):
            return ""  # Cycle detected
            
        return "".join(result)

def test_alien_dictionary():
    """
    Test function to verify the implementation
    """
    solution = Solution()
    
    # Test cases
    test_cases = [
        (["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"], "wertf"),
        (["z", "x"], "zx"),
        (["z", "x", "z"], ""),  # Invalid case
        ([], ""),  # Empty case
        (["abc", "ab"], ""),  # Invalid case where prefix is longer
    ]
    
    for i, (words, expected) in enumerate(test_cases):
        result = solution.alienOrder(words)
        print(f"Test case {i + 1}:")
        print(f"Input: {words}")
        print(f"Expected: {expected}")
        print(f"Got: {result}")
        print(f"{'✓ Passed' if result == expected else '✗ Failed'}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_alien_dictionary()
```

This implementation includes:

1. A `Solution` class with the main `alienOrder` method that solves the alien dictionary problem
2. A topological sort-based approach using BFS
3. Proper handling of edge cases:
   - Empty input
   - Invalid cases where a longer word is a prefix
   - Cycles in the character order
4. A test function to verify the implementation
5. Clear comments explaining the logic and implementation details
6. Type hints and proper Python conventions

The algorithm works by:
1. Building a graph from the character relationships in the words
2. Using topological sort to determine the character order
3. Detecting invalid cases and cycles
4. Returning the final character order or empty string for invalid cases

The time complexity is O(C + N) where C is the total length of all words and N is the number of unique characters in the alien alphabet.

The space complexity is O(1) since the alphabet size is limited to 26 characters.
