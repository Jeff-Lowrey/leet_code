 * # Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy
 * (clone) of the graph.
 *
 * Each `node` in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
 * Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>[[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>Graph node is cloned with all connections preserved</dd>

 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * To clone a graph, we need to create new nodes and preserve the neighbor relationships.
 * The key challenge is handling `cycles - we` need to avoid infinite loops.
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Handle empty graph**: Return None immediately if input node is None
 * 2. **Initialize hash map**: Create a dictionary to map original nodes to their clones and track visited nodes
 * 3. **Start DFS traversal**: Begin recursive depth-first search from the given node
 * 4. **Check if already cloned**: If current node is already in the hash map, return its clone (prevents infinite loops)
 * 5. **Clone current node**: Create a new node with the same value and add the mapping to hash map
 * 6. **Clone neighbors recursively**: For each neighbor of current node, recursively call DFS to get cloned neighbor
 * 7. **Build neighbor connections**: Append each cloned neighbor to the current clone's neighbor list, preserving graph structure
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * By using a hash map to track visited nodes, we ensure each node is cloned exactly once, preventing infinite loops in the presence of cycles. The DFS/BFS traversal guarantees we visit every reachable node, and by cloning neighbors recursively, we preserve the exact structure and relationships of the original graph. The hash map serves both as a visited tracker and a lookup for already-cloned nodes.
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
 * Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
 * Step 1: Start BFS from node 1
 *   Create clone of node 1
 *   visited = {1: Node(1)}
 *
 * Step 2: Process neighbors of node 1 (nodes 2 and 4)
 *   Clone node 2, add to visited
 *   Clone node 4, add to visited
 *   Connect node 1 to nodes 2 and 4
 *
 * Step 3: Process node 2 neighbors (nodes 1 and 3)
 *   Node 1 already cloned
 *   Clone node 3, connect to node 2
 *
 * Step 4: Process remaining nodes
 *   Build all connections maintaining graph structure
 *
 * Output: Cloned graph with same structure
 * ```
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(V + E) - visit each node and edge once
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(V) - hash map and recursion stack
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - **Null/empty graph**: Return None immediately
 * - **Single node with no neighbors**: Clone node with empty neighbor list
 * - **Graph with cycles**: Visited map prevents infinite loops
 * - **Fully connected graph**: All nodes are neighbors of each other
 * - **Self-loops**: Node points to itself, handled by visited check
