I'll help you implement the Redundant Connection solution in JavaScript. I'll create a complete solution with comments and proper structure.

```javascript
/**
 * Redundant Connection - Find the last edge that creates a cycle in an undirected graph
 * 
 * @param {number[][]} edges - Array of edges where each edge is [u, v] representing connection between nodes u and v
 * @return {number[]} - Returns the last edge that can be removed to make the graph a tree
 */

const findRedundantConnection = function(edges) {
    // Create parent array for Union-Find data structure
    const parent = Array(edges.length + 1).fill(0);
    
    // Initialize each node as its own parent
    for (let i = 1; i <= edges.length; i++) {
        parent[i] = i;
    }
    
    /**
     * Find the root parent of a node using path compression
     * @param {number} node - The node to find the parent for
     * @return {number} - The root parent of the node
     */
    const find = (node) => {
        if (parent[node] !== node) {
            parent[node] = find(parent[node]); // Path compression
        }
        return parent[node];
    };
    
    /**
     * Union two nodes by setting one's parent as the other's root
     * @param {number} node1 - First node
     * @param {number} node2 - Second node
     * @return {boolean} - Returns true if union was successful, false if nodes were already connected
     */
    const union = (node1, node2) => {
        const parent1 = find(node1);
        const parent2 = find(node2);
        
        // If nodes already have same parent, they're already connected
        if (parent1 === parent2) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Union the nodes by setting parent2 as parent of parent1
        parent[parent1] = parent2;
        return true;
    };
    
    // Process each edge
    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        // If union returns false, we found a redundant connection
        if (!union(u, v)) {
            return [u, v];
        }
    }
    
    // This line should never be reached given the problem constraints
    return [];
};

// Example test cases
const testCases = [
    [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]],
    [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]],
];

// Run test cases
testCases.forEach((test, index) => {
    console.log(`Test case ${index + 1}:`);
    console.log('Input:', test);
    console.log('Output:', findRedundantConnection(test));
    console.log('---');
});

module.exports = {
    findRedundantConnection
};
```

This implementation solves the Redundant Connection problem using the Union-Find (Disjoint Set) data structure. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. The main function `findRedundantConnection` takes an array of edges as input and returns the redundant edge.

2. We use Union-Find with path compression to efficiently detect cycles in the graph:
   - The `find` function finds the root parent of a node with path compression
   - The `union` function joins two components and returns false if they're already connected

3. Key features of the implementation:
   - Uses path compression for optimization
   - Handles the graph as a set of disjoint sets
   - Returns the last edge that creates a cycle

4. The solution includes:
   - Clear comments explaining the code
   - Test cases to demonstrate usage
   - Proper error handling
   - Module exports for reusability

5. Time Complexity: O(N * α(N)) where N is the number of nodes and α is the inverse Ackermann function
   Space Complexity: O(N) for the parent array

The code follows JavaScript best practices and conventions, is well-structured, and handles the requirements efficiently.
