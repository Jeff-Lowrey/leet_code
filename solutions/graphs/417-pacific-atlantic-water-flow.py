This implementation provides a solution to the Pacific Atlantic Water Flow problem with the following features:

1. Two different approaches: DFS and BFS implementations
2. Clear documentation and comments explaining the logic
3. Type hints for better code readability
4. Proper error handling for edge cases
5. Test cases to verify the implementation
6. Clean code structure following Python conventions

The solution handles the following requirements:
- Efficiently finds cells that can flow to both oceans
- Handles edge cases (empty matrix, single cell)
- Uses proper data structures (sets for visited cells, queue for BFS)
- Includes comprehensive documentation
- Follows Python best practices

The code can be run directly to test the implementation with the included test cases.
