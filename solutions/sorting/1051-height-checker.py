# 1051. Height Checker

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.

You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).

Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>Expected (sorted): [1,1,1,2,3,4]</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Minimum swaps needed to sort students by height</dd>
</dl>

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
We need to compare the current order with the expected sorted order and count mismatches. The key insight is that the expected order is simply the current array sorted.

### APPROACH:
1. **Create expected array**: Sort the current heights array
2. **Compare arrays**: Count positions where current != expected
3. **Return count**: Number of students in wrong positions

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- The expected order is the sorted version of current heights
- Any position where current[i] != sorted[i] needs adjustment
- Simple comparison gives us the mismatch count

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Expected (sorted): [1,1,1,2,3,4]

Compare:
Current:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
Match:     ‚úì ‚úì ‚úó ‚úì ‚úó ‚úó

Mismatches at indices: 2, 4, 5
Count: 3
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n log n)
Due to sorting the array

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(n)
For the sorted expected array

### EDGE CASES:
- **Already sorted**: Return 0 (no mismatches)
- **Reverse sorted**: Return n (all positions wrong)
- **Single element**: Return 0 (trivially sorted)
- **All same heights**: Return 0 (any order is sorted)
- **Few elements out of place**: Count specific mismatches
