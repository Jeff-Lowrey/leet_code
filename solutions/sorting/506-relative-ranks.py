# 506. Relative Ranks

You are given an integer array score of size n, where score[i] is the score of the ith athlete
in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be unique.

The athletes are placed based on their scores, where the 1st place athlete has the highest score,
the 2nd place athlete has the 2nd highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines
their rank:

- The 1st place athlete's rank is "Gold Medal".
- The 2nd place athlete's rank is "Silver Medal".
- The 3rd place athlete's rank is "Bronze Medal".
- For the 4th place to the nth place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the xth place athlete's rank is "x").

Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the rank of the ith athlete.

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
We need to map each score to its rank. Sorting gives us the order, but we need to maintain
the original indices. Use sorting with indices or create a score-to-rank mapping.

### APPROACH:
1. **Create index-score pairs**: Track original positions
2. **Sort by score descending**: Highest score first
3. **Assign ranks**: Gold/Silver/Bronze for top 3, numbers for rest
4. **Map back to original positions**: Use original indices

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Sorting by score gives us the ranking order
- Tracking original indices lets us place ranks correctly
- Dictionary mapping from score to rank is efficient
- Special strings for top 3, numbers for rest

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: score = [5,4,3,2,1]

Step 1: Create (score, index) pairs
[(5,0), (4,1), (3,2), (2,3), (1,4)]

Step 2: Sort by score descending
[(5,0), (4,1), (3,2), (2,3), (1,4)]

Step 3: Assign ranks
Rank 1 (Gold Medal): score 5, index 0
Rank 2 (Silver Medal): score 4, index 1
Rank 3 (Bronze Medal): score 3, index 2
Rank 4: score 2, index 3
Rank 5: score 1, index 4

Step 4: Map back to original indices
answer[0] = "Gold Medal"
answer[1] = "Silver Medal"
answer[2] = "Bronze Medal"
answer[3] = "4"
answer[4] = "5"

Output: ["Gold Medal","Silver Medal","Bronze Medal","4","5"]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n log n)
For sorting the scores

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(n)
For storing score-rank mappings and result

### EDGE CASES:
- Single athlete (gets Gold Medal)
- Two athletes (Gold and Silver only)
- Three athletes (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
- Large number of athletes
