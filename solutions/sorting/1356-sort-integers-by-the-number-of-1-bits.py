# 1356. Sort Integers By The Number Of 1 Bits
# Difficulty: Easy
You are given an integer array arr. Sort the integers in the array in ascending order by the number
of 1's in their binary representation and in case of two or more integers have the same number of 1's
you have to sort them in ascending order.

Return the array after sorting it.

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
We need a two-level sort: first by count of 1-bits, then by value. Python's sort is stable,
so we can sort by value first, then by bit count. Or use a tuple key for simultaneous sorting.

### APPROACH:
1. **Count 1-bits**: Use bin(n).count('1') or bit manipulation
2. **Create sort key**: Tuple (bit_count, value)
3. **Sort array**: Use sorted() with custom key function
4. **Return result**: Sorted array

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- bin(n).count('1') counts 1-bits in binary representation
- Python sorts tuples lexicographically (first element, then second)
- Stable sort maintains order when keys are equal
- Lambda function provides clean, concise key

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n log n)
- Counting bits: O(log max_value) per number = O(n log max_value)
- Sorting: O(n log n)
- Total: O(n log n) dominates

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n)
For the sorted result array

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

Binary representations and bit counts:
0 = 0b0     -> 0 ones
1 = 0b1     -> 1 one
2 = 0b10    -> 1 one
3 = 0b11    -> 2 ones
4 = 0b100   -> 1 one
5 = 0b101   -> 2 ones
6 = 0b110   -> 2 ones
7 = 0b111   -> 3 ones
8 = 0b1000  -> 1 one

Group by bit count (then sort by value):
0 ones: [0]
1 one:  [1, 2, 4, 8]
2 ones: [3, 5, 6]
3 ones: [7]

Output: [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
```

### EDGE CASES:
- Array with single element
- All numbers have same bit count
- Array with zeros
- Large numbers (up to 10^4)

### OPTIMIZATIONS:
- **Brian Kernighan's algorithm**: n & (n-1) for bit counting
- **Precompute bit counts**: If sorting many times
- **Built-in bit_count()**: Python 3.10+ has int.bit_count()
