# 274. H Index
# Difficulty: Medium
Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher
received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value
of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at
least h times.

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
The h-index is the largest number h where at least h papers have h or more citations.
Sorting helps us find this threshold efficiently. We can also use counting for O(n) solution.

### APPROACH:
1. **Sort citations** in descending order
2. **Iterate through sorted array**: For each position i, check if citations[i] >= i+1
3. **Find maximum h**: The h-index is the largest i+1 where citations[i] >= i+1
4. **Alternative**: Count papers with at least k citations for each k

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- After sorting in descending order, citations[i] is the (i+1)th highest citation count
- If citations[i] >= i+1, we have at least i+1 papers with i+1+ citations
- The h-index is the maximum such i+1 value
- Counting approach: For each h, count papers with >= h citations

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n log n)
For sorting approach. Counting approach is O(n).

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)
If sorting in place, O(n) for sorting with extra space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]

Sorted (descending): [6,5,3,1,0]

Check each position:
i=0: citations[0]=6 >= 1? YES (h >= 1)
i=1: citations[1]=5 >= 2? YES (h >= 2)
i=2: citations[2]=3 >= 3? YES (h >= 3)
i=3: citations[3]=1 >= 4? NO  (h < 4)
i=4: citations[4]=0 >= 5? NO  (h < 5)

Maximum h where condition holds: h=3
This means: 3 papers with at least 3 citations each

Verification:
Papers: [6,5,3,1,0]
Papers with >= 3 citations: 6,5,3 = 3 papers ‚úì
Papers with >= 4 citations: 6,5 = 2 papers (not enough for h=4)

Output: 3
```

### EDGE CASES:
- All zeros (h-index = 0)
- All citations > n (h-index = n)
- Single paper
- Empty array

### OPTIMIZATIONS:
- **Counting approach**: O(n) time using bucket counting
- **Binary search**: Can also use binary search on sorted array
- **No sorting needed**: Counting is more efficient
