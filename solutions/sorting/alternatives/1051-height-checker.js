/**
 * # Difficulty: Easy
 *
 * # 1051. Height Checker
 *
 * A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.
 *
 * You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).
 *
 * Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * <dl class="example-details">
 * <dt>Input:</dt>
 * <dd>Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]</dd>
 * <dt>Output:</dt>
 * <dd>Expected (sorted): [1,1,1,2,3,4]</dd>
 * <dt>Explanation:</dt>
 * <dd>Minimum swaps needed to sort students by height</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <details>
 * <summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>
 *
 * ### INTUITION:
 * We need to compare the current order with the expected sorted order and count mismatches. The key insight is that the expected order is simply the current array sorted.
 *
 * ### APPROACH:
 * 1. **Create expected array**: Sort the current heights array
 * 2. **Compare arrays**: Count positions where current != expected
 * 3. **Return count**: Number of students in wrong positions
 *
 * ### WHY THIS WORKS:
 * - The expected order is the sorted version of current heights
 * - Any position where current[i] != sorted[i] needs adjustment
 * - Simple comparison gives us the mismatch count
 *
 * ### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
 * ```
 * Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
 * Expected (sorted): [1,1,1,2,3,4]
 *
 * Compare:
 * Current:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
 * Expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
 * Match:     ‚úì ‚úì ‚úó ‚úì ‚úó ‚úó
 *
 * Mismatches at indices: 2, 4, 5
 * Count: 3
 * ```
 *
 * ### TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * O(n log n)
 * Due to sorting the array
 *
 * ### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(n)
 * For the sorted expected array
 *
 * ### EDGE CASES:
 * - **Already sorted**: Return 0 (no mismatches)
 * - **Reverse sorted**: Return n (all positions wrong)
 * - **Single element**: Return 0 (trivially sorted)
 * - **All same heights**: Return 0 (any order is sorted)
 * - **Few elements out of place**: Count specific mismatches
