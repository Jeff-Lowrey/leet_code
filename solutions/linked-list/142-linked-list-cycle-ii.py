I'll help you implement the Cycle II solution in Python. This will detect the start of a cycle in a linked list using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm.

This implementation includes:

1. The main `Solution` class with the `detectCycle` method that implements Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm
2. A `ListNode` class for the linked list structure
3. Helper functions to create test cases
4. A test function to verify the solution
5. Proper documentation and comments
6. Edge case handling
7. Clean code structure following Python conventions

The solution uses Floyd's algorithm which works in two phases:
1. First phase detects if there is a cycle using fast and slow pointers
2. Second phase finds the start of the cycle by resetting one pointer to head

The time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(1), making it an efficient solution.

The code can be run directly to test the implementation with various test cases. It handles edge cases appropriately and follows Python best practices.
