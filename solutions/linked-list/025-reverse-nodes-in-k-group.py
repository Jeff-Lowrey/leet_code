# 025. Reverse Nodes In K Group

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[2, 1, 4, 3, 5]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"Expected {expected}, got {list_to_array(result)}"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Reversing nodes in k=2 groups: [1,2,3,4,5] becomes [2,1,4,3,5]</dd>
</dl>

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Reverse k nodes at a time using standard reversal. Track previous group's tail and current group's head/tail. Connect groups after reversal. Stop if fewer than k nodes remain.

### APPROACH:
1. **Check if k nodes exist**: Count k nodes ahead; if fewer than k, return head
2. **Reverse k nodes**: Use standard linked list reversal for first k nodes
3. **Track prev and current**: Initialize prev = None, current = head
4. **Iterate k times**: For i in range(k), reverse links
5. **Connect with previous group**: After reversal, original head is now tail
6. **Recursive call**: head.next = reverseKGroup(current, k) to process remaining
7. **Return new head**: Return prev (new head of reversed group)

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Iteratively reverse k-node groups, keeping track of prev group's tail
- Check if k nodes remaining before reversing prevents partial reversal
- Connecting prev_tail to new group head maintains list continuity
- Dummy node simplifies handling first group edge case
- O(n) time as each node visited twice (check + reverse), O(1) space

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Step 1: Reverse first k nodes
  [1,2] ‚Üí [2,1]

Step 2: Reverse next k nodes
  [3,4] ‚Üí [4,3]

Step 3: Last group < k, keep as is
  [5] ‚Üí [5]

Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
