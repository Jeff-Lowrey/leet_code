I'll help you create a solution for the "Has Cycle" problem in Python. This implementation will detect if a linked list has a cycle using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm.

```python
"""
LeetCode 141: Linked List Cycle
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

This solution implements Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm (also known as cycle-finding algorithm)
to detect if a linked list has a cycle.

This implementation includes:

1. A `ListNode` class to represent nodes in the linked list
2. The main `has_cycle` function implementing Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm
3. Helper functions to create test linked lists with and without cycles
4. A comprehensive test suite
5. Clear comments explaining the implementation
6. Proper handling of edge cases

The solution uses Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm, which:
- Uses two pointers moving at different speeds (slow and fast)
- If there's a cycle, the pointers will eventually meet
- If there's no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes, and the space complexity is O(1) as we only use two pointers regardless of input size.

The code includes test cases to verify the implementation works correctly for various scenarios, including:
- Lists with cycles
- Lists without cycles
- Empty lists
- Single-node lists
