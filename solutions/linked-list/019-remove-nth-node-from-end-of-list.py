# 019. Remove Nth Node From End Of List

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Example:**

<dl class="example-details">
<dt>Input:</dt>
<dd>[1, 2, 3, 5]</dd>
<dt>Output:</dt>
<dd>"Expected {expected}, got {list_to_array(result)}"</dd>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd>Removing 2nd node from end of [1,2,3,4,5] gives [1,2,3,5]</dd>
</dl>

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Use two pointers with n-step gap. Move fast pointer n steps ahead. Then move both until fast reaches end. Slow is now at the node before target. Remove target node.

### APPROACH:
1. **Create dummy node**: Initialize dummy = ListNode(0, head) to handle edge cases
2. **Use two pointers**: Set fast = slow = dummy for the two-pointer technique
3. **Advance fast pointer**: Move fast n+1 steps ahead to create n-node gap
4. **Move both pointers**: Advance both fast and slow until fast reaches end
5. **Slow at target's previous**: When fast is null, slow is at node before target
6. **Remove target node**: Set slow.next = slow.next.next to skip target node
7. **Return new head**: Return dummy.next as the new head of modified list

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Two-pointer technique with gap of n creates (n+1) node offset
- Dummy node handles edge case of removing first node elegantly
- When fast reaches end, slow is at node before target (nth from end)
- Single pass O(n) instead of two-pass (count length, then remove)
- Gap ensures slow.next points to node to remove, enabling removal

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Step 1: Use fast and slow pointers
  fast moves n+1 steps: reaches node 3
  slow at dummy node

Step 2: Move both until fast reaches end
  fast at 5, slow at 3
  slow.next = slow.next.next (remove 4)

Output: [1,2,3,5]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n)

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1)

### EDGE CASES:
- Empty input handling
- Single element cases
- Large input considerations
