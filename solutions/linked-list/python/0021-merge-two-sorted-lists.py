### INTUITION:
The key insight is that use dummy node to handle edge cases. Compare nodes from both lists. Advance pointer of smaller node. Continue until both lists exhausted. Return dummy.next.

### APPROACH:
1. **Create dummy node**: Initialize dummy = ListNode(0) to simplify list construction
2. **Initialize current pointer**: Set current = dummy to track position in result list
3. **Compare while both exist**: While list1 and list2 are not None
4. **Choose smaller node**: If list1.val < list2.val, attach list1 to current, advance list1
5. **Otherwise choose list2**: Else attach list2 to current, advance list2
6. **Advance current**: Move current = current.next after each attachment
7. **Attach remaining nodes**: After loop, attach remaining nodes from non-empty list
8. **Return result**: Return dummy.next as the merged list head

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Dummy node eliminates special cases for empty lists and first node selection
- Comparing values at each step ensures merged list maintains sorted order
- Attaching remaining nodes works because both input lists are already sorted
- Only pointer manipulation (no new nodes created) achieves O(1) space
- Single pass through both lists achieves O(m + n) time

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
Input:
```
list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
```

Step 1: Compare and merge
1 ≤ 1: add 1 from list1
2 > 1: add 1 from list2
2 ≤ 3: add 2 from list1
4 > 3: add 3 from list2
4 ≤ 4: add 4 from list1
Remaining: 4 from list2

Output:
```
[1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
**O(n)**
- Single pass through input

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
**O(1)**
- Constant extra space

### EDGE CASES:
- **Empty input**: Handle when input is empty
- **Single element**: Handle single-element inputs
- **Boundary values**: Handle minimum/maximum valid values
