2. Add Two Numbers
Medium

You are given two `non-empty` linked lists representing two `non-negative` integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: `342 + 465` = 807.

<details>
<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
This mimics elementary school `addition! Since` digits are in reverse order,
we can add from `left` to `right` (which corresponds to least significant digit first).
We need to handle carries just like manual addition.

### KEY INSIGHT:
- Reverse order means we naturally process least significant digits first
- Use a "carry" variable to handle sums ‚â• 10
- Continue until both lists are exhausted AND no carry remains

### APPROACH:
1. Create dummy `head` for `result` linked list
2. Process both lists simultaneously with carry
3. For each position: `sum` = `val1 + val2` + carry
4. Create new `node` with (`sum` % 10), update carry = `sum` // 10
5. Continue until both lists empty and `carry = 0`

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
l1 = [2,4,3] represents 342
l2 = [5,6,4] represents 465

Step 1: `2 + 5` + 0(carry) = 7, `carry = 0` ‚Üí node(7)
Step 2: `4 + 6` + 0(carry) = 10, `carry = 1` ‚Üí node(0)
Step 3: `3 + 4` + 1(carry) = 8, `carry = 0` ‚Üí node(8)

Result: [7,0,8] represents 807
```

### EDGE CASES:
- **Different length lists**: treat missing digits as 0
- **Final carry**: create additional node if carry > 0
- **One list empty**: continue with other list + carry

### WHY LINKED LIST?
- Numbers can be arbitrarily large (beyond int/long limits)
- Linked list allows dynamic size
- Reverse order makes addition natural (no need to reverse)

### ELEMENTARY MATH PARALLEL:
```
    342
  + 465
  -----
    807
```
We add column by column from `right`, which corresponds to `left-to`-`right` in reversed lists.
