"""### METADATA:
**Techniques**: Bucket Sort, Frequency Counting
**Data Structures**: Hash Map (Counter), Buckets (Array of Lists)
**Time Complexity**: O(n)
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

### INTUITION:
The key insight is to use bucket sort based on frequency. Since the maximum frequency any element can have is n (all elements the same), we can create n+1 buckets where bucket[i] contains all numbers that appear exactly i times. First count frequencies with a hash map, then place numbers into frequency buckets, finally collect k elements from highest frequency buckets first. This achieves O(n) time by avoiding sorting.

### APPROACH:
1. **Count frequencies**: Build hash map of number → frequency for all elements in nums
2. **Create frequency buckets**: Initialize array of n+1 buckets, where bucket[freq] holds all numbers with that frequency
3. **Fill buckets**: For each (number, frequency) pair from hash map, add number to bucket[frequency]
4. **Collect top k**: Traverse buckets from highest frequency (n) down to lowest, collecting elements until we have k total
5. **Return result**: Slice to ensure exactly k elements returned (handle case where last bucket has more than needed)

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- This ensures that bucket sort by frequency achieves O(n) time vs heap's O(n log k)
- This ensures that frequency can't exceed n, so we need at most n+1 buckets (index 0 to n)
- This ensures that hash map counts frequencies in O(n), bucketing also O(n)
- This ensures that collecting from buckets high to low gets k elements without full sort
- This ensures that trade space O(n) for buckets to gain linear time complexity

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
Input:
```
nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
```

Step 1: Count frequencies using Counter
freq_map = {1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1}
Step 2: Build max heap with negative frequencies
heap = [(-3, 1), (-2, 2), (-1, 3)]
Step 3: Extract k most frequent elements
Alternative (Bucket Sort):

Steps:
Step 1: - Pop: (-3, 1) → result = [1]
Step 2: - Pop: (-2, 2) → result = [1, 2]
Step 3: Create buckets by frequency
Step 4: buckets[3] = [1]
Step 5: buckets[2] = [2]
Step 6: buckets[1] = [3]
Step 7: Collect from highest frequency buckets
Step 8: - From bucket 3: add 1
Step 9: - From bucket 2: add 2

Output:
```
[1, 2]
[1, 2]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
**O(n)** - where n is the length of the nums array. We perform three linear passes: (1) count frequencies in hash map **O(n)**, (2) place numbers into frequency buckets **O(unique elements)** ≤ **O(n)**, (3) collect k elements from buckets **O(n)** in worst case. Total: **O(n)** + **O(n)** + **O(n)** = **O(3n)** = **O(n)**. This is better than heap-based solutions which would be **O(n log k)** or sorting-based solutions which would be **O(n log n)**.

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
**O(n)** - We use a frequency hash map that stores at most n unique elements (**O(n)**), plus a buckets array of size n+1 where each bucket can hold numbers (**O(n)** total across all buckets in worst case), plus the result array of size k (**O(k)** ≤ **O(n)**). Total space: **O(n)** + **O(n)** + **O(k)** = **O(n)**. The dominant factors are the hash map and buckets array, both **O(n)**.

### EDGE CASES:
- **Empty input**: Handle when input is empty
- **Single element**: Handle single-element inputs
- **Boundary values**: Handle minimum/maximum valid values
