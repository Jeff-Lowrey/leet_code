"""### METADATA:
**Techniques**: Hash Map Grouping, Sorted String as Key
**Data Structures**: Hash Map (defaultdict)
**Time Complexity**: O(n × k log k)
**Space Complexity**: O(n × k)

### INTUITION:
The key insight is that group strings by their "anagram signature" - a canonical representation that's the same for all anagrams. Two common signatures: sorted characters or character frequency count.

### APPROACH:
1. **Create signature**: For each string, generate a canonical form (sorted chars or char counts)
2. **Group by signature**: Use a hash map where signature is key, list of anagrams is value
3. **Return groups**: Extract all value lists from the hash map

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- This ensures that all anagrams have the same signature (sorted characters or character counts)
- This ensures that hash map automatically groups strings with identical signatures
- This ensures that different anagrams will have different signatures

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
Input:
```
["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
```

Using sorted string as key:

Steps:
Step 1: "eat" → key "aet" → group 1
Step 2: "tea" → key "aet" → group 1
Step 3: "tan" → key "ant" → group 2
Step 4: "ate" → key "aet" → group 1
Step 5: "nat" → key "ant" → group 2
Step 6: "bat" → key "abt" → group 3

Final groups:
```
"aet": ["eat", "tea", "ate"]
"ant": ["tan", "nat"]
"abt": ["bat"]
```

Output:
```
[["eat","tea","ate"], ["tan","nat"], ["bat"]]
```

### TIME COMPLEXITY:
**O(n × k log k)** - where n is the number of strings and k is the maximum string length. For the sorting approach: we iterate through all n strings (**O(n)**), and for each string we sort its k characters (**O(k log k)**). Total: **O(n × k log k)**. The character counting approach is more efficient at **O(n × k)** since counting characters takes **O(k)** time per string without sorting.

### SPACE COMPLEXITY:
**O(n × k)** - We store all n strings in the hash map, each with average length k. The map keys (sorted strings or character counts) also take **O(k)** space per unique anagram group. In the worst case where all strings are unique, we have n groups, each storing one string of length k, giving us **O(n × k)** total space. The character count array uses **O(26)** = **O(1)** space per string, which doesn't affect the overall **O(n × k)** complexity.

### EDGE CASES:
- **Empty string array**: Return empty list
- **Single string**: Return [[string]]
- **No anagrams**: Each string in its own group
- **All anagrams of each other**: Return single group with all strings
- **Empty strings**: All empty strings grouped together
