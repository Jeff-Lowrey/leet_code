I'll help you create a solution for the Longest Consecutive sequence problem in JavaScript. I'll write a clean implementation with comments and proper error handling.

```javascript
/**
 * @file Longest Consecutive Sequence Implementation
 * @description Finds the length of the longest consecutive sequence in an unsorted array
 */

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums - Array of numbers
 * @return {number} - Length of longest consecutive sequence
 */
function longestConsecutive(nums) {
    // Handle edge cases
    if (!nums || nums.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Create a Set for O(1) lookup
    const numSet = new Set(nums);
    let maxLength = 0;

    // Iterate through each number in the array
    for (const num of numSet) {
        // Only start checking sequences from the smallest number in the sequence
        // If num-1 exists, this isn't the start of a sequence
        if (!numSet.has(num - 1)) {
            let currentNum = num;
            let currentLength = 1;

            // Count consecutive numbers
            while (numSet.has(currentNum + 1)) {
                currentNum++;
                currentLength++;
            }

            // Update maxLength if current sequence is longer
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
        }
    }

    return maxLength;
}

// Test cases
const testCases = [
    [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],           // Expected: 4 (1,2,3,4)
    [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1],   // Expected: 9 (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
    [],                                // Expected: 0
    [1],                               // Expected: 1
    [1, 2, 0, 1]                      // Expected: 3 (0,1,2)
];

// Run test cases
testCases.forEach((test, index) => {
    console.log(`Test ${index + 1}:`);
    console.log(`Input: [${test}]`);
    console.log(`Output: ${longestConsecutive(test)}`);
    console.log('---');
});

// Export the function for potential module usage
module.exports = longestConsecutive;
```

This implementation provides a solution to find the longest consecutive sequence in an unsorted array with the following features:

1. **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the input array
2. **Space Complexity**: O(n) to store the Set

Key features of the implementation:

1. Uses a Set for O(1) lookup time
2. Optimized to only start checking sequences from the smallest number in each sequence
3. Includes comprehensive test cases
4. Handles edge cases (empty array, null input)
5. Follows JavaScript best practices and conventions
6. Includes clear comments explaining the logic
7. Exports the function for modular usage

The algorithm works by:
1. Converting the input array to a Set for efficient lookup
2. Finding the start of each sequence (numbers that don't have a predecessor)
3. Counting consecutive numbers from each sequence start
4. Tracking the maximum sequence length found

The code includes test cases demonstrating various scenarios and edge cases, making it easy to verify the implementation works correctly.
