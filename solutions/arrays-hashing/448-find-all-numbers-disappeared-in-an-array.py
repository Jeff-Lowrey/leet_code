I'll help you create a solution for finding disappeared numbers in Python. I'll write a complete implementation that meets the requirements and includes proper documentation.

Find Disappeared Numbers - Python Implementation

This module provides a solution to find all numbers that are missing from
an array of n integers where the integers are in the range [1, n].

Example:
    Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
    Output: [5,6]
    Explanation: 5 and 6 are missing from the range [1,8]

class Solution:
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:

        Space Complexity: O(1) - excluding the output array

This implementation provides a solution to find disappeared numbers with the following features:

1. Clean and efficient implementation using O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
2. Proper type hints and documentation using docstrings
3. Comprehensive test cases to verify the solution
4. Clear comments explaining the logic
5. Follows Python best practices and PEP 8 conventions
6. Handles edge cases (empty array, no missing numbers, duplicate numbers)

The solution uses an in-place marking technique to avoid using extra space:
1. For each number in the array, mark its presence by making the number at its corresponding index negative
2. After marking, any positive numbers indicate missing values in the original array

The implementation includes:
- Type hints for better code clarity
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Test cases for various scenarios
- Main block for example usage
- Clean code structure following Python conventions
