56. Merge Intervals
Medium

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all
overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals
that cover all the intervals in the input.

Example:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
To merge overlapping intervals, we need to first sort them by start time, then walk through them sequentially, merging adjacent intervals when they overlap.

### APPROACH:
1. **Sort intervals** by start time to ensure we process them in order
2. **Initialize merged list** with the first interval
3. **For each remaining interval**:
   - If it overlaps with the last merged interval (current.start ‚â§ last.end)
   - Merge by extending the end time to max(current.end, last.end)
   - Otherwise, add as a new separate interval

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Sorting ensures we never miss potential merges between non-adjacent intervals
- Since intervals are sorted by start time, we only need to check overlap with the most recently added interval
- Two intervals [a,b] and [c,d] overlap if c ‚â§ b (assuming a ‚â§ c after sorting)

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n log n)
### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1) excluding output

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
After sorting: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]] (already sorted)

Step 1: merged = [[1,3]]
Step 2: [2,6] overlaps with [1,3] (2 ‚â§ 3) ‚Üí merge to [1,6]
Step 3: [8,10] doesn't overlap with [1,6] (8 > 6) ‚Üí add separately
Step 4: [15,18] doesn't overlap with [8,10] (15 > 10) ‚Üí add separately
Result: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
```

### EDGE CASES:
- Single interval ‚Üí return as-is
- No overlaps ‚Üí return sorted intervals
- Complete overlap ‚Üí one interval contains another
- Adjacent intervals with touching endpoints ‚Üí merge them
