I'll help you create a solution for the Valid Sudoku problem. I'll write a clean, well-commented implementation that follows Python best practices.

Valid Sudoku Implementation
This module provides a solution to determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid.

A valid Sudoku board must satisfy the following rules:
1. Each row must contain digits 1-9 without repetition
2. Each column must contain digits 1-9 without repetition
3. Each 3x3 sub-box must contain digits 1-9 without repetition

This implementation includes:

1. A clear class structure with a main solution method
2. Proper type hints using Python's typing module
3. Comprehensive comments explaining the logic
4. Efficient solution using hash sets (via defaultdict)
5. Test cases to verify the implementation
6. Proper Python conventions and best practices
7. Edge case handling (empty cells)

The solution uses a single pass through the board to check all three Sudoku conditions simultaneously, making it efficient with O(1) space complexity (since the board size is fixed at 9x9) and O(1) time complexity.

The code checks each cell and verifies that the number doesn't already exist in:
- The current row
- The current column
- The current 3x3 box

The implementation is complete and ready to run, with test cases included to verify the functionality.
