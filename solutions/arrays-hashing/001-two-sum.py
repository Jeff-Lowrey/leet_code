"""
Two Sum
Easy

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the
two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may
not use the same element twice.

Example:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

### INTUITION:
The key insight is to use a hash map to store numbers we've seen so far. For each number, we check if its complement (target - current_number) exists in our hash map. This allows us to find the pair in a single pass.

### APPROACH:
1. Create a hash map to store number ‚Üí index mapping
2. For each number in the array:
   - Calculate complement = target - current_number
   - If complement exists in hash map, we found our answer
   - Otherwise, store current number and its index in hash map
3. Return the indices when complement is found

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Instead of checking every pair (O(n¬≤)), we use hash map for O(1) lookup
- We only need to store numbers we've already seen
- When we find a complement, we know the current index and the stored index

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:

Input:
```
nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
```

**Step 1:** `num=2`, `complement=7`, `seen={}` ‚Üí store `{2: 0}`

**Step 2:** `num=7`, `complement=2`, `seen={2: 0}` ‚Üí found! return `[0, 1]`

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
Single pass through array with O(1) hash map lookups

### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n)
Hash map stores up to n elements in worst case

### EDGE CASES:
- No solution exists: problem guarantees exactly one solution
- Duplicate values: hash map handles correctly by index
- Two same numbers sum to target: works if at different indices
- Negative numbers: algorithm works for any integers
