347. Top K Frequent Elements
Medium

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements.
You may return the answer in any order.

Example:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]

<summary><b>üîç SOLUTION EXPLANATION</b></summary>

### INTUITION:
Find the k most frequent elements by first counting frequencies, then selecting the top k by frequency. Multiple approaches exist with different time complexities.

### APPROACH (Bucket Sort - Optimal):
1. **Count frequencies** using a hash map
2. **Create buckets** where bucket[i] contains all elements with frequency i
3. **Traverse buckets** from highest frequency to lowest, collecting k elements

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- Maximum possible frequency is n (all elements the same)
- Bucket sort is linear when range is limited (0 to n frequencies)
- By traversing from highest frequency bucket, we get top k elements

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n) - bucket sort approach
### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n)

### MULTIPLE APPROACHES:

#### Approach 1: Bucket Sort (Optimal O(n))
Use frequency as bucket index, traverse from high to low frequency

#### Approach 2: Min Heap (O(n log k))
Maintain a min heap of size k with the k most frequent elements

#### Approach 3: Sorting (O(n log n))
Sort all elements by frequency, take top k

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH (Bucket Sort):
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2

Step 1: Count frequencies
{1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1}

Step 2: Create buckets (indices 0-6)
buckets[0] = []
buckets[1] = [3]     # element 3 appears 1 time
buckets[2] = [2]     # element 2 appears 2 times
buckets[3] = [1]     # element 1 appears 3 times
buckets[4] = []
buckets[5] = []
buckets[6] = []

Step 3: Traverse from high frequency (index 6 down to 1)
i=6: buckets[6] = [] ‚Üí skip
i=5: buckets[5] = [] ‚Üí skip
i=4: buckets[4] = [] ‚Üí skip
i=3: buckets[3] = [1] ‚Üí add 1, result = [1]
i=2: buckets[2] = [2] ‚Üí add 2, result = [1,2] ‚Üí length = k, return

Output: [1,2]
```

### WHY BUCKET SORT IS OPTIMAL:
- Frequency range is bounded by array length (1 to n)
- Creating and filling buckets takes O(n) time
- Traversing buckets takes O(n) time in worst case
- Total: O(n) time, optimal for this problem
