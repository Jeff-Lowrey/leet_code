"""
238. Product of Array Except Self
Medium

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that answer[i] is equal
to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums`[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

Example:
Input: `nums` = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

### INTUITION:
For each position i, the answer is the product of all elements to the left of i multiplied by the product of all elements to the right of i. We can compute this efficiently in two passes.

### APPROACH:
1. **Left pass**: For each position i, store the product of all elements to the left
2. **Right pass**: For each position i, multiply by the product of all elements to the right
3. **Space optimization**: Use the result array to store left products, then multiply in-place with right products

### WHY THIS WORKS:
- The product of all elements except nums[i] = (product of elements before i) √ó (product of elements after i)
- By separating into left and right products, we avoid division and handle edge cases naturally
- Two passes ensure we visit each element exactly twice

### TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
### SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1) excluding output array

### EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Left pass (storing left products):
i=0: left_product = 1, result[0] = 1, left_product *= nums[0] = 1
i=1: left_product = 1, result[1] = 1, left_product *= nums[1] = 2
i=2: left_product = 2, result[2] = 2, left_product *= nums[2] = 6
i=3: left_product = 6, result[3] = 6, left_product *= nums[3] = 24
result = [1,1,2,6]

Right pass (multiplying by right products):
i=3: right_product = 1, result[3] *= 1 = 6, right_product *= nums[3] = 4
i=2: right_product = 4, result[2] *= 4 = 8, right_product *= nums[2] = 12
i=1: right_product = 12, result[1] *= 12 = 12, right_product *= nums[1] = 24
i=0: right_product = 24, result[0] *= 24 = 24, right_product *= nums[0] = 24
result = [24,12,8,6]
```

### EDGE CASES:
- Array with zeros ‚Üí handled naturally (product becomes 0)
- Single element ‚Üí left and right products are both 1
- Two elements ‚Üí each element's result is the other element
